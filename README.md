Diploma details 
Diploma title: Access to HE Diploma (Policing) 
Learning aim code: 40013182 
Validation start date: 1st August 2024 
Validation end date: 31st July 2027 
SSA sector code: 
• Tier 1: 1 - Health, Public Services and Care 
• Tier 2: 1.4 – Public services 
The Access to HE Diploma (Policing) has been developed in collaboration with the 
Metropolitan Police Service. Whilst the Diploma has been developed in collaboration with 
the Met Police, centres could work with a local police force to deliver this Diploma. 
Diploma aims 
The Access to HE Diploma (Policing) offers adult returners a coherent, integrated and 
supported year of study through which they will gain the knowledge, awareness, skills and 
confidence necessary for successful undergraduate studying in the intended progression 
routes for this Diploma. The course aims to provide a balance of essential study skills with 
specialist subject knowledge to enable the students to be prepared for the academic and 
practical rigours of undergraduate study in HE Policing entry programmes. It must however be 
noted that the Access to HE Diploma does not provide guaranteed entry to UK Higher 
Education Institutions. 
Its primary aims are: 
• To provide HE progression opportunities for adults who, because of social, educational 
or individual circumstances, do not have the necessary qualifications;Access to HE Diploma Specification 2024-2025 
3 
• To give learners a general introduction to the basic concepts, methods, and key areas 
of knowledge within the core disciplines taken and offer a coherent and stimulating 
framework within which they can broaden their intellectual outlook and make 
connections between subject areas; 
• To help learners to develop and consolidate the various skills required to enable them to 
cope successfully with the demands of undergraduate study and to become 
independent, self-directed learners; 
• To establish a positive and supportive learning environment within which learners can 
build their confidence through successful learning and the sharing of their experience; 
• To provide the personal, educational support (including preparation for application and 
interview techniques) needed to facilitate learners pursuing their aims within the 
framework of the course. 
Target learners 
• Adults who, because of social, educational or individual circumstances, were unable to 
participate in or benefit from initial education. 
• Adults from groups under-represented in higher education. 
• Adults seeking a change of direction because of unemployment or lack of career 
opportunities in their previous field and who have a demonstrable interest in entering a 
Policing career. 
Potential progression routes 
This Diploma has been designed for progression onto the Police Constable Degree 
Apprenticeship and related HE Policing entry degree programmes. 
Entry guidance 
There are no centrally specified formal requirements for qualifications on entry; however there 
is usually the expectation that the learner will have literacy, communication skills and 
numeracy at Level 2 or above. For learners wishing to progress to a Police Constable Degree 
Apprenticeship, Level 2 English is a pre-requisite with an expectation that Level 2 Functional 
Skills Maths will be attained by the end of the first year of the degree apprenticeship. 
Advice and guidance 
Learners should be aware that degrees undertaken via a specific force will be subject to a 
successful application, vetting and offer. 
Centres delivering this Diploma must, as part of advice and guidance, make learners aware that 
they will not be eligible for the Access to HE Diploma loan waiver for their adult learner loan as 
the Police Constable Degree Apprenticeship is not eligible for funding under Student Finance 
England. However, learners would be salaried and would not be eligible for any HE fees. Access to HE Diploma Specification 2024-2025

Guided learning hours 
The Access to HE Diploma represents 600 notional Guided Learning Hours (GLH) with courses 
generally delivered in 450 GLH. This may vary between centres and may depend on whether the 
course is being delivered through blended learning. It is expected a centre delivering the 
course will clearly outline the intended delivery in terms of total hours and how this is broken 
down weekly over the period of study.

• The same level of facilities and resources should be available at each site where the 
Diploma is delivered. 
Staffing requirements 
• Staff delivering, assessing or internally moderating on the Access to HE course must 
have the professional competence and level of subject expertise necessary to deliver 
and assess the units available on the Diploma. They should be qualified at Level 4 or 
above in the named subject, or in a discipline that includes the subject. For example, a 
tutor with a Social Science degree may be able to teach both Psychology and Sociology. 
• Staff should have or be working towards a teaching qualification. 
• Staff should have knowledge and understanding of the Access to HE Diploma, including 
QAA regulations, AVA assessment regulations, the QAA Grading Scheme and the Rules

18INTRODUCTION FROM THE COMMISSIONER 
3 
I am looking for someone outstanding to join my team who can help us manage the daily 
challenges London poses, and who can also drive the change necessary for the Met to keep 
pace with this vibrant city. London is a fantastic place and I have always been incredibly 
proud to serve the capital. It is a diverse, growing and ever-changing city with national 
impact and international reach. 
How the Met operates has changed significantly in recent years, achieving a step change in 
effectiveness, efficiency and confidence. But the scale of our ambition for the future is even 
greater. It has to be. 
There are many challenges facing policing. I have no doubt the Met can meet them all – to 
transform, to exploit the opportunities of the digital age, to get the best from our people and 
most importantly to make London the safest it can be. 
The Mayor has set out his priorities in his Police and Crime Plan – a bold and challenging 
agenda with a focus on priorities. My particular focus is to bear down on violence in all its 
forms, protecting the vulnerable and the security of our city. I want us to become even 
closer to our communities, building confidence and trust. 
One of my central aims for the Met is that we are a modern police service, but with the best 
of policing’s traditional values at our core. To do that we need every single part of the force 
to be well led, every officer and staff member to feel supported and to have the right 
equipment to help them serve London. 
I want all our people to believe in the Met and the tangible difference they make every day 
across the city so that we can become even better at keeping London safe. I want the public 
to believe in us too and so I want us to be more transparent about what we do on their 
behalf.INTRODUCTION FROM THE COMMISSIONER 
4 
Our values of courage, compassion, integrity and professionalism remain at the heart of 
everything we do. My commitment to you is to lead the Met in a way that respects and nurtures 
these very traditional values but which also puts us at the forefront of modern policing and 
maintains Scotland Yard’s well-earned international reputation. 
This information pack will give you further insight into the role, and the qualities and experience 
we are looking for. 
I very much hope you will be inspired by this opportunity to serve with the Met. 
Cressida Dick CommissionerABOUT THE MET 
5 
Founded by Sir Robert Peel in 1829, the Metropolitan Police Service (the Met) is one of the 
oldest police services in the world. From the beginning, the purpose of the Met has been to 
serve and protect the people of London by providing a professional police service. This remains 
our purpose. 
Our vision is to make London the safest global city, a city in which people are free to be 
themselves, express themselves and flourish. We strive to earn the trust and confidence of 
every community and take pride in the quality of our service so that people love, respect and 
are proud of London’s Metropolitan Police. 
The Met is responsible for maintaining the peace and is accountable in law for the exercise of 
policing powers, and to the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC) for the delivery of 
efficient and effective policing, management of resources and expenditure. At all times the 
Commissioner and her officers remain operationally independent, in the service of the public. 
The Met ‘New Scotland Yard’ is internationally recognised for its history, law enforcement and 
skills in fighting crime, however a constantly changing city needs an accessible police service 
which reflects and understands the people it serves. It needs an effective police service 
equipped for the 21st century with a visible service which every day continues to earn the trust 
and confidence of Londoners. 
Today, the Met is made up of more than 39,000 officers and staff, plus thousands of volunteers; 
we are one of the largest employers in London and the South East of England. The territory we 
serve covers 620 square miles and is home to over 8.6 million people. The Met is the UK’s 
largest police service and has 25% of the total police budget for England and Wales. 
We’re proud that the Met is seen as a world leader in policing. The ‘Scotland Yard’ brand is 
known around the world as a symbol of quality investigation and traditional values of policing. 
Thanks to this reputation, our services are highly sought after, either through using our officers 
and staff in operational matters or by training others and giving them the opportunity to learn 
from our experiences.ABOUT THE MET

LONDON: THE AMAZING GLOBAL CITY WE POLICE 
London is unique: ‘the world under one roof’. 
Its ever-changing population is set to grow towards 9.2 million by 2020 and exceed 10 million the 
following decade. It is probably one of themost diverse cities in the world. The complexities of 
policing a city on this scale are huge. A seat of Parliamentary, Royal and Diplomatic power, London is 
a centre for protest, for criminality, for transport. 
Londoners tend to be younger than the rest of the UK, more than three million of us were born 
abroad, just under half of which arrived in the UK less than 10 years ago. 
London is also the world’s most popular business and travel destination, receiving 
31.5 million Visits in 2015, 12.9 million from the UK. It is a global city, recognised around the world, 
economically, politically, financially and creatively. London’s greatness comes from its openness to 
the world, and this in turn has helped build world-renowned institutions which have preserved its 
safety and stability. 
There are over 200 languages spoken in London, and around 40% of the population is Black or 
Minority Ethnic (BAME). These numbers are predicted to grow further as the city expands and 
develops as an international centre. 
Of the six largest world faiths, almost four million Christians and onemillion Muslims live in London, 
and Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism and Sikhism each have more than 80,000 followers in the capital. 
London’s population swells due to an influx of commuters during the day and tourists throughout 
the year - in greater volumes than anywhere else in the UK. 
London is one of the safest global cities in the world already. Nevertheless, criminality within 
London is on a more prevalent and serious level than other cities and communities across England & 
Wales. Crime in the capital is often connected to organised criminality and national and 
international networks of offending. London has, throughout our lifetime, been a place that 
terrorists want to attack. 
This creates a unique policing environment. Everyone joining us needs the ability to deliver 
outstanding policing to the communities of London.ABOUT THE MET 
7 
WE HAVE A HIGHLY AMBITIOUS TRANSFORMATION AGENDA 
Our transformation programme 
Like many public bodies, we work with constrained resources, increasing demand and a changing 
environment that require us to make policing in London ever more effective. Recognising the 
challenges and the opportunities to improve our services, we are currently in the midst of one of 
the biggest transformation programmes of any public sector organisation. 
Our Transformation Portfolio aims to deliver transformation right across our functions and 
departments, to modernise the force as a whole, and keep our resources focused on priority 
areas, providing an effective and efficient service to all Londoners. 
In the past twelve months we have delivered: 
• A more visible neighbourhood presence, with about 1,700 dedicated officers whose sole 
focus is to respond to the issues that matter to local communities (two police constables 
(PCs) as Dedicated Ward Officers (DWOs), and one Police Community Support Officer 
(PCSO) in all 629 London wards). These officers are tackling local priorities and anti-social 
behaviour, identifying people vulnerable to, or at risk of becoming involved in crime, and 
solving local issues. 
• A strengthened local police. By regrouping a small number of boroughs to deliver core 
local policing functions (neighbourhoods, safeguarding, response and investigation) 
across borough boundaries, we can integrate and enhance our capability, and improve the 
safeguarding of vulnerable people with more officers dedicated to prevention. 
Management costs will reduce, which means we can maximise the availability of officers 
on the frontline. People, buildings, technology and fleet currently in one borough will be 
shared across a Basic Command Unit (BCU), making it easier to provide resources in line 
with each local area’s peaks in demand. In addition, we have opened up access to a police 
career through direct entry superintendents, inspectors and detectives, attracting a 
diverse pool of applicants who may not have otherwise considered a career in policing. 
• Significant enhancements to our service. Our new website offers relevant local 
information and prevention advice. It is includes online crime reporting capability: 11 per 
cent of crimes are now reported online. A new Telephone and Digital Investigation Unit 
complements this, reducing demand on our response teams, allowing them to focus their 
efforts more effectively. Body Worn Video (BWV) cameras were rolled out to over 22,000 
officers, more than any other police service in the world. By being the first British police 
service to share footage digitally with the criminal justice service, we have improved 
security, reduced the demand on officer time and saved £3.5 million per year in operating 
costs. Complaints and investigations can become more evidence-based with supporting 
BWV material. ABOUT THE MET 
8 
• Smarter Working bringing a significant range of savings and qualitative benefits, 
including improved morale, officer visibility and service effectiveness and efficiency. As a 
result of the rollout of 30,000 tablet and mobile devices, we have the ability over time to 
support our officers with better applications so they spend more time visibly assisting the 
public and less time in our buildings; we also expect to be able to better serve the public, 
with our officers having access to the right information at the time when they need it. 
We have a clear roadmap that sets out our transformation plans to 2020. We have reviewed our 
processes and capabilities, our organisational, technological and digital strengths and 
weaknesses; and are constantly assessing future demand and current gaps to identify where 
change is necessary, where investments are required, and where benefits can be realised. 
We need to make further savings, whilst continuing to improve our operational effectiveness and 
efficiency in the face of increasing overall demand, higher expectations from the public and the 
added complexity of a digital age. 
Technology and estate transformation are some of the key enablers of that change, but 
organisational culture and learning, and good information management are also vital to make it a 
success. ABOUT THE MET

For London… 
A modern, transformed and more efficient Met will Protect London by investing more ofits time 
on the areasof greatestthreat, risk and harm; 
We will make every community safer through our new neighbourhood policing service anda

For Our People… 
We will provide real time information to keep them safe and manage risk, and provide 
professional support so they can concentrate on their job; 
We will deliver a digital service from contact to court to help meet demand, and trust in them to 
do their job well and have good professional judgement so their time is spent on activities that 
have the most impact.CORPORATE PRIORITIES

knife and gun crime, sexual offending, domestic abuse and safeguarding vulnerable people from 
predatory behaviour. 
Mobilise partners and the public 
We know that safety requires action and intervention beyond the police service. We will work 
with partners and communities to help keep them safe and support them in preventing crime. 
We will work harder to earn the trust of more young people and ethnic minority communities. 
Achieve the best outcomes in the pursuit of justice and in the support of victims 
We have a fundamental responsibility to uphold the rule of law and to ensure that victims 
receive the best possible outcome. We will do this by catching offenders and by ensuring victims 
of crime receive both justice and the support they need from us and our partners. 
As an organisation, we want to lead 21st century policing and: 
Seize the opportunities of data and digital tech to become a world leader in policing 
We want to harness data and use advanced technologies to our advantage in the pursuit of criminals, 
rising to the challenge of a fast-moving data-driven digital age. We will make information and insight more 
accessible internally, and externally, to support evidence-based decisions and promote public confidence. 
We will strive to enhance our global reputation for excellence and expertise in policing.11BACKGROUND 
12 
The MPS Assessment Centre deals with the interviewing and assessment for all posts where we 
recruit in large volumes. This involves assessments for new Police Officers, Police Community 
Support Officers, Special Constables, Designated Detention Officers, as well as the recruitment 
of new Detectives. 
Every role will have a slightly different assessment process, based on job specifications. This will 
range from an interview and written test, to a half-day assessment including interview, role 
plays, interactive and video based scenarios. 
We assess both Police Officers and Police Community Support Officers to the National 
assessment standard. This National standard is a Home Office regulation for Police Officers, so 
every force in the country must recruit to this level. Only assessors that have been trained to the 
National Standard, may undertake this kind of assessment. The training course is delivered over 
a 4 day period and takes place at our Assessment Centre premises in West Brompton, London. 
Primarily, this is where our Community Assessors are used. 
With the introduction in 2018 of a refreshed police Recruitment process called Day One, which 
incorporates IT for candidates and assessors use, all assessors will be required to be comfortable 
with the use of technology in the assessment process. All training is provided on using the tech, 
as well as the assessment material. 
After successful completion of the Community Assessor training course, assessors will then be 
offered work on a causal basis. Assessment activity will fluctuate dependent on the Recruitment 
activity taking place and their availability. It is a flexible role and is designed to enable assessors 
the ability to work assessing around other responsibilities. Based on demand community 
assessors may assess from between 2-3 days a week to a couple of days a month. 
It is possible that once a Community Assessor has gained experience in the National method of 
assessment, that if they are suitable, further training may be offered to participate in other kinds 
of interviews (for example Detectives and Police Community Support Officers). There is also the 
opportunity to develop further in the role, with the Quality Assurance role, or delivering training. 
It is important we have a team of professionally trained assessors to support our recruitment 
assessments. Bringing with you a variety of different experience and to reflect the diversity of 
the communities we serve.COMMUNITY ASSESSORS -PERFORMANCE FRAMEWORK

This project was part of an an employment application to Uturn Data Solutions to test infrastructure skills. They provided a pre-coded AWS DynamoDB and Python based API application that was to be pulled and stood up to run on cloud infrastructure. I utilized AWS, OpenTofu (a fork of Terraform), and GitLab CI. There are two web servers behind a load balancer for redundancy.

About SSCP
The Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP) is the ideal certification for those with proven technical skills and practical, hands-on security knowledge in operational IT roles. It provides confirmation of a practitioner’s ability to implement, monitor and administer IT infrastructure in accordance with information security policies and procedures that ensure data confidentiality, integrity and availability.
The broad spectrum of topics included in the SSCP Common Body of Knowledge (CBK) ensure its relevancy across all disciplines in the field of information security. Successful candidates are competent in the following domains:
•	Security Concepts and Practices
•	Access Controls
•	Risk Identification, Monitoring, and Analysis
•	Incident Response and Recovery
•	Cryptography
•	Network and Communications Security
•	Systems and Application Security
Experience Requirements
Candidates must have a minimum of one year cumulative work experience in one or more of the domains of the SSCP CBK. A one year prerequisite pathway will be granted for candidates who received a degree (bachelors or masters) in a cybersecurity program.
A candidate that doesn’t have the required experience to become an SSCP may become an Associate of ISC2 by successfully passing the SSCP examination. The Associate of ISC2 will then have two years to earn the one year required experience. You can learn more about SSCP experience requirements and how to account for part-time work and internships at www.isc2.org/Certifications/SSCP/SSCP-Experience-Requirements.
Accreditation
SSCP is in compliance with the stringent requirements of ANSI/ISO/IEC Standard 17024.

•	Studio 
•	Article • 12/09/2021 
•	If you haven't downloaded and installed Visual Studio and the Microsoft C/C++ tools 
•	yet, here's how to get started. 
•	Visual Studio 2022 Installation 
•	Welcome to Visual Studio 2022! In this version, it's easy to choose and install just the 
•	features you need. And because of its reduced minimum footprint, it installs quickly and 
•	with less system impact. 
•	７ Note 
•	This topic applies to installation of Visual Studio on Windows. Visual Studio Code 
•	is a lightweight, cross-platform development environment that runs on Windows, 
•	Mac, and Linux systems. The Microsoft C/C++ for Visual Studio Code extension 
•	supports IntelliSense, debugging, code formatting, auto-completion. Visual Studio 
•	for Mac doesn't support Microsoft C++, but does support .NET languages and 
•	cross-platform development. For installation instructions, see Install Visual Studio 
•	for Mac. 
•	Want to know more about what else is new in this version? See the Visual Studio release 
•	notes. 
•	Ready to install? We'll walk you through it, step-by-step. 
•	Step 1 - Make sure your computer is ready for Visual 
•	Studio 
•	Before you begin installing Visual Studio: 
•	1. Check the system requirements. These requirements help you know whether your 
•	computer supports Visual Studio 2022. 
•	2. Apply the latest Windows updates. These updates ensure that your computer has 
•	both the latest security updates and the required system components for Visual 
•	Studio.3. Reboot. The reboot ensures that any pending installs or updates don't hinder the 
•	Visual Studio install. 
•	4. Free up space. Remove unneeded files and applications from your %SystemDrive% 
•	by, for example, running the Disk Cleanup app. 
•	For questions about running previous versions of Visual Studio side by side with Visual 
•	Studio 2022, see the Visual Studio 2022 Platform Targeting and Compatibility page. 
•	Step 2 - Download Visual Studio 
•	Next, download the Visual Studio bootstrapper file. To do so, choose the following 
•	button to go to the Visual Studio download page. Select the edition of Visual Studio that 
•	you want and choose the Free trial or Free download button. 
•	Download Visual Studio 
•	Step 3 - Install the Visual Studio installer 
•	Run the bootstrapper file you downloaded to install the Visual Studio Installer. This new 
•	lightweight installer includes everything you need to both install and customize Visual 
•	Studio. 
•	1. From your Downloads folder, double-click the bootstrapper that matches or is 
•	similar to one of the following files: 
•	vs_community.exe for Visual Studio Community 
•	vs_professional.exe for Visual Studio Professional 
•	vs_enterprise.exe for Visual Studio Enterprise 
•	If you receive a User Account Control notice, choose Yes to allow the bootstrapper 
•	to run. 
•	2. We'll ask you to acknowledge the Microsoft License Terms and the Microsoft 
•	Privacy Statement . Choose Continue. 
•	Step 4 - Choose workloads 
•	After the installer is installed, you can use it to customize your installation by selecting 
•	the workloads, or feature sets, that you want. Here's how. 
•	1. Find the workload you want in the Installing Visual Studio screen.For core C and C++ support, choose the "Desktop development with C++" 
•	workload. It comes with the default core editor, which includes basic code editing 
•	support for over 20 languages, the ability to open and edit code from any folder 
•	without requiring a project, and integrated source code control. 
•	Additional workloads support other kinds of development. For example, choose 
•	the "Universal Windows Platform development" workload to create apps that use 
•	the Windows Runtime for the Microsoft Store. Choose "Game development with 
•	C++" to create games that use DirectX, Unreal, and Cocos2d. Choose "Linux 
•	development with C++" to target Linux platforms, including IoT development. 
•	The Installation details pane lists the included and optional components installed 
•	by each workload. You can select or deselect optional components in this list. For 
•	example, to support development by using the Visual Studio 2017 or 2015 
•	compiler toolsets, choose the MSVC v141 or MSVC v140 optional components. You 
•	can add support for MFC, the experimental Modules language extension, 
•	IncrediBuild, and more. 
•	2. After you choose the workload(s) and optional components you want, choose 
•	Install. 
•	Next, status screens appear that show the progress of your Visual Studio 
•	installation. 
•	 Tip 
•	At any time after installation, you can install workloads or components that you 
•	didn't install initially. If you have Visual Studio open, go to Tools > Get Tools andFeatures... which opens the Visual Studio Installer. Or, open Visual Studio Installer 
•	from the Start menu. From there, you can choose the workloads or components 
•	that you wish to install. Then, choose Modify. 
•	Step 5 - Choose individual components (Optional) 
•	If you don't want to use the Workloads feature to customize your Visual Studio 
•	installation, or you want to add more components than a workload installs, you can do 
•	so by installing or adding individual components from the Individual components tab. 
•	Choose what you want, and then follow the prompts. 
•	Step 6 - Install language packs (Optional) 
•	By default, the installer program tries to match the language of the operating system 
•	when it runs for the first time. To install Visual Studio in a language of your choosing, 
•	choose the Language packs tab from the Visual Studio Installer, and then follow the 
•	prompts. 
•	Change the installer language from the command line 
•	Another way that you can change the default language is by running the installer from 
•	the command line. For example, you can force the installer to run in English by using the 
•	following command: vs_installer.exe --locale en-US . The installer will remember this 
•	setting when it's run the next time. The installer supports the following language tokens: 
•	zh-cn, zh-tw, cs-cz, en-us, es-es, fr-fr, de-de, it-it, ja-jp, ko-kr, pl-pl, pt-br, ru-ru, and tr-tr.Step 7 - Change the installation location (Optional) 
•	You can reduce the installation footprint of Visual Studio on your system drive. You can 
•	choose to move the download cache, shared components, SDKs, and tools to different 
•	drives, and keep Visual Studio on the drive that runs it the fastest. 
•	） Important 
•	You can select a different drive only when you first install Visual Studio. If you've 
•	already installed it and want to change drives, you must uninstall Visual Studio and 
•	then reinstall it. 
•	Step 8 - Start developing 
•	1. After Visual Studio installation is complete, choose the Launch button to get 
•	started developing with Visual Studio. 
•	2. On the start window, choose Create a new project. 
•	3. In the search box, enter the type of app you want to create to see a list of available 
•	templates. The list of templates depends on the workload(s) that you chose during 
•	installation. To see different templates, choose different workloads. 
•	You can also filter your search for a specific programming language by using the 
•	Language drop-down list. You can filter by using the Platform list and the Project 
•	type list, too. 
•	4. Visual Studio opens your new project, and you're ready to code! 
•	When Visual Studio is running, you're ready to continue to the next step. 
•	Next Steps 
•	Create a C++ projectWhat is Visual Studio?

•	on the command line. That's what you create in Visual Studio in this step. 
•	Prerequisites 
•	Have Visual Studio with the Desktop development with C++ workload installed 
•	and running on your computer. If it's not installed yet, see Install C++ support in 
•	Visual Studio. 
•	Create your app project 
•	Visual Studio uses projects to organize the code for an app, and solutions to organize 
•	your projects. A project contains all the options, configurations, and rules used to build 
•	your apps. It manages the relationship between all the project's files and any external 
•	files. To create your app, first, create a new project and solution. 
•	1. In Visual Studio, open the File menu and choose New > Project to open the Create 
•	a new Project dialog. Select the Console App template that has C++, Windows, 
•	and Console tags, and then choose Next.2. In the Configure your new project dialog, enter HelloWorld in the Project name 
•	edit box. Choose Create to create the project. 
•	Visual Studio creates a new project. It's ready for you to add and edit your source 
•	code. By default, the Console App template provides source code for a "Hello 
•	World" app, like this: 
•	When the code looks like this in the editor, you're ready to go on to the next step 
•	and build your app.I ran into a problem.

•	Come here for solutions to common issues when you create your first C++ project. 
•	Create your app project: issues 
•	The New Project dialog should show a Console App template that has C++, Windows, 
•	and Console tags. If you don't see it, there are two possible causes. It might be filtered 
•	out of the list, or it might not be installed. First, check the filter dropdowns at the top of 
•	the list of templates. Set them to C++, Windows, and Console. The C++ Console App 
•	template should appear; otherwise, the Desktop development with C++ workload isn't 
•	installed. 
•	To install Desktop development with C++, you can run the installer right from the New 
•	Project dialog. Choose the Install more tools and features link at the bottom of the 
•	template list to start the installer. If the User Account Control dialog requests 
•	permissions, choose Yes. In the installer, make sure the Desktop development with C++ 
•	workload is checked. Then choose Modify to update your Visual Studio installation. 
•	If another project with the same name already exists, choose another name for your 
•	project. Or, delete the existing project and try again. To delete an existing project, delete 
•	the solution folder (the folder that contains the helloworld.sln file) in File Explorer.

•	project 
•	Article • 07/01/2024 
•	In Create a C++ console app project you created a C++ console app project and 
•	entered your code. Now you can build and run it within Visual Studio. Then, run it as a 
•	stand-alone app from the command line. 
•	Prerequisites 
•	Have Visual Studio with the Desktop development with C++ workload installed 
•	and running on your computer. If it's not installed, follow the steps in Install C++ 
•	support in Visual Studio. 
•	Create a "Hello, World!" project. By default, it contains code to print Hello World! . 
•	If you haven't done this step yet, follow the steps in Create a C++ console app 
•	project. 
•	If Visual Studio looks like this, you're ready to build and run your app: 
•	Build and run your code in Visual Studio1. To build your project, from the main menu choose Build > Build Solution. The 
•	Output window shows the results of the build process. 
•	2. To run the code, on the menu bar, choose Debug, Start without debugging. 
•	A console window opens and then runs your app. When you start a console app in 
•	Visual Studio, it runs your code, then prints "Press any key to continue . . ." to give 
•	you a chance to see the output.Congratulations! You created your first "Hello, world!" console app in Visual Studio! 
•	Press a key to dismiss the console window and return to Visual Studio. 
•	I ran into a problem. 
•	Run your code in a command window 
•	Normally, you run console apps at the command prompt, not in Visual Studio. Once 
•	Visual Studio builds your app, you can run it from a command window. Here's how to 
•	find and run your new app in a command prompt window. 
•	1. In Solution Explorer, select the HelloWorld solution (not the HelloWorld project) 
•	and right-click to open the context menu. Choose Open Folder in File Explorer to 
•	open a File Explorer window in the HelloWorld solution folder. 
•	2. In the File Explorer window, open the x64 folder and then the Debug folder. This 
•	folder contains your app, HelloWorld.exe , and debugging files. Hold down the 
•	Shift key and right-click on HelloWorld.exe to open the context menu. Choose 
•	Copy as path to copy the path to your app to the clipboard. If you see 
•	HelloWorld.exe.recipe , it's because you did the Open Folder in File Explorer step 
•	on the HelloWorld project instead of the HelloWorld solution. Navigate up a level in 
•	File Explorer to get to the solution folder. This folder also contains a x64\Debug\ 
•	folder, where HelloWorld.exe is. 
•	3. To open a command prompt window, press Windows+R to open the Run dialog. 
•	Enter cmd.exe in the Open textbox, then choose OK to run a command prompt 
•	window. 
•	4. In the command prompt window, right-click to paste the path to your app into the 
•	command prompt. Press Enter to run your app.Congratulations, you built and ran a console app in Visual Studio! 
•	I ran into a problem. 
•	Next Steps 
•	Once you build and run this simple app, you're ready for more complex projects. For

•	If the path shown in File Explorer ends in \HelloWorld\HelloWorld , you opened the 
•	HelloWorld project instead of the HelloWorld solution. You won't see your app in the 
•	x64\Debug folder. Navigate up a level in File Explorer to get to the solution folder, the 
•	first HelloWorld in the path. This folder also contains a x64\Debug folder, where your 
•	app is. 
•	You can also navigate to the solution x64\Debug folder at the command line to run your 
•	app. Your app won't run from other directories without specifying the path to the app. 
•	However, you can copy your app to another directory and run it from there. It's also 
•	possible to copy it to a directory specified by your PATH environment variable, then run 
•	it from anywhere. 
•	If you don't see Copy as path in the shortcut menu, dismiss the menu, and then hold 
•	down the Shift key while you open it again. This command is just for convenience. You 
•	can also copy the path to the folder from the File Explorer search bar, and paste it into 
•	the Run dialog, and then enter the name of your executable at the end. It's just a little 
•	more typing, but it has the same result.

•	Article • 11/07/2022 
•	Since its creation, C++ has become one of the most widely used programming 
•	languages in the world. Well-written C++ programs are fast and efficient. The language 
•	is more flexible than other languages: It can work at the highest levels of abstraction, 
•	and down at the level of the silicon. C++ supplies highly optimized standard libraries. It 
•	enables access to low-level hardware features, to maximize speed and minimize memory 
•	requirements. C++ can create almost any kind of program: Games, device drivers, HPC, 
•	cloud, desktop, embedded, and mobile apps, and much more. Even libraries and 
•	compilers for other programming languages get written in C++. 
•	One of the original requirements for C++ was backward compatibility with the C 
•	language. As a result, C++ has always permitted C-style programming, with raw 
•	pointers, arrays, null-terminated character strings, and other features. They may enable 
•	great performance, but can also spawn bugs and complexity. The evolution of C++ has 
•	emphasized features that greatly reduce the need to use C-style idioms. The old C
•	programming facilities are still there when you need them. However, in modern C++ 
•	code you should need them less and less. Modern C++ code is simpler, safer, more 
•	elegant, and still as fast as ever. 
•	The following sections provide an overview of the main features of modern C++. Unless 
•	noted otherwise, the features listed here are available in C++11 and later. In the 
•	Microsoft C++ compiler, you can set the /std compiler option to specify which version 
•	of the standard to use for your project. 
•	Resources and smart pointers 
•	One of the major classes of bugs in C-style programming is the memory leak. Leaks are 
•	often caused by a failure to call delete for memory that was allocated with new . 
•	Modern C++ emphasizes the principle of resource acquisition is initialization (RAII). The 
•	idea is simple. Resources (heap memory, file handles, sockets, and so on) should be 
•	owned by an object. That object creates, or receives, the newly allocated resource in its 
•	constructor, and deletes it in its destructor. The principle of RAII guarantees that all 
•	resources get properly returned to the operating system when the owning object goes 
•	out of scope. 
•	To support easy adoption of RAII principles, the C++ Standard Library provides three 
•	smart pointer types: std::unique_ptr, std::shared_ptr, and std::weak_ptr. A smart pointer 
•	handles the allocation and deletion of the memory it owns. The following exampleshows a class with an array member that is allocated on the heap in the call to 
•	make_unique() . The calls to new and delete are encapsulated by the unique_ptr class. 
•	When a widget object goes out of scope, the unique_ptr destructor will be invoked and 
•	it will release the memory that was allocated for the array. 
•	C++ 
•	Whenever possible, use a smart pointer to manage heap memory. If you must use the 
•	new and delete operators explicitly, follow the principle of RAII. For more information, 
•	see Object lifetime and resource management (RAII). 
•	C-style strings are another major source of bugs. By using std::string and std::wstring, 
•	you can eliminate virtually all the errors associated with C-style strings. You also gain the 
•	benefit of member functions for searching, appending, prepending, and so on. Both are 
•	highly optimized for speed. When passing a string to a function that requires only read
•	only access, in C++17 you can use std::string_view for even greater performance benefit. 
•	The standard library containers all follow the principle of RAII. They provide iterators for 
•	safe traversal of elements. And, they're highly optimized for performance and have been 
•	thoroughly tested for correctness. By using these containers, you eliminate the potential 
•	#include <memory> 
•	class widget 
•	{ 
•	private: 
•	std::unique_ptr<int[]> data; 
•	public: 
•	widget(const int size) { data = std::make_unique<int[]>(size); } 
•	void do_something() {} 
•	}; 
•	void functionUsingWidget() { 
•	widget w(1000000); // lifetime automatically tied to enclosing scope 
•	// constructs w, including the w.data gadget member 
•	// ... 
•	w.do_something(); 
•	// ... 
•	} // automatic destruction and deallocation for w and w.data 
•	std::string and std::string_view 
•	std::vector and other Standard Library 
•	containersfor bugs or inefficiencies that might be introduced in custom data structures. Instead of 
•	raw arrays, use vector as a sequential container in C++. 
•	C++ 
•	vector<string> apples; 
•	apples.push_back("Granny Smith"); 
•	Use map (not unordered_map ) as the default associative container. Use set, multimap, 
•	and multiset for degenerate and multi cases. 
•	C++ 
•	map<string, string> apple_color; 
•	// ... 
•	apple_color["Granny Smith"] = "Green"; 
•	When performance optimization is needed, consider using: 
•	Unordered associative containers such as unordered_map. These have lower per
•	element overhead and constant-time lookup, but they can be harder to use 
•	correctly and efficiently. 
•	Sorted vector . For more information, see Algorithms. 
•	Don't use C-style arrays. For older APIs that need direct access to the data, use accessor 
•	methods such as f(vec.data(), vec.size()); instead. For more information about 
•	containers, see C++ Standard Library Containers. 
•	Standard Library algorithms 
•	Before you assume that you need to write a custom algorithm for your program, first 
•	review the C++ Standard Library algorithms. The Standard Library contains an ever
•	growing assortment of algorithms for many common operations such as searching, 
•	sorting, filtering, and randomizing. The math library is extensive. In C++17 and later, 
•	parallel versions of many algorithms are provided. 
•	Here are some important examples: 
•	for_each , the default traversal algorithm (along with range-based for loops). 
•	transform , for not-in-place modification of container elements 
•	find_if , the default search algorithm. 
•	sort , lower_bound , and the other default sorting and searching algorithms.To write a comparator, use strict < and use named lambdas when you can. 
•	C++ 
•	C++11 introduced the auto keyword for use in variable, function, and template 
•	declarations. auto tells the compiler to deduce the type of the object so that you don't 
•	have to type it explicitly. auto is especially useful when the deduced type is a nested 
•	template: 
•	C++ 
•	C-style iteration over arrays and containers is prone to indexing errors and is also 
•	tedious to type. To eliminate these errors, and make your code more readable, use 
•	range-based for loops with both Standard Library containers and raw arrays. For more 
•	information, see Range-based for statement. 
•	C++ 
•	auto comp = [](const widget& w1, const widget& w2) 
•	{ return w1.weight() < w2.weight(); } 
•	sort( v.begin(), v.end(), comp ); 
•	auto i = lower_bound( v.begin(), v.end(), widget{0}, comp ); 
•	auto instead of explicit type names 
•	map<int,list<string>>::iterator i = m.begin(); // C-style 
•	auto i = m.begin(); // modern C++ 
•	Range-based for loops 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	#include <vector> 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	std::vector<int> v {1,2,3}; 
•	// C-style 
•	for(int i = 0; i < v.size(); ++i) 
•	{ 
•	std::cout << v[i]; 
•	}Macros in C and C++ are tokens that are processed by the preprocessor before 
•	compilation. Each instance of a macro token is replaced with its defined value or 
•	expression before the file is compiled. Macros are commonly used in C-style 
•	programming to define compile-time constant values. However, macros are error-prone 
•	and difficult to debug. In modern C++, you should prefer constexpr variables for 
•	compile-time constants: 
•	C++ 
•	In modern C++, you can use brace initialization for any type. This form of initialization is 
•	especially convenient when initializing arrays, vectors, or other containers. In the 
•	following example, v2 is initialized with three instances of S . v3 is initialized with three 
•	instances of S that are themselves initialized using braces. The compiler infers the type 
•	of each element based on the declared type of v3 . 
•	C++ 
•	// Modern C++: 
•	for(auto& num : v) 
•	{ 
•	std::cout << num; 
•	} 
•	} 
•	constexpr expressions instead of macros 
•	#define SIZE 10 // C-style 
•	constexpr int size = 10; // modern C++ 
•	Uniform initialization 
•	#include <vector> 
•	struct S 
•	{ 
•	std::string name; 
•	float num; 
•	S(std::string s, float f) : name(s), num(f) {} 
•	}; 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	// C-style initialization 
•	std::vector<S> v; 
•	S s1("Norah", 2.7);For more information, see Brace initialization. 
•	Modern C++ provides move semantics, which make it possible to eliminate unnecessary 
•	memory copies. In earlier versions of the language, copies were unavoidable in certain 
•	situations. A move operation transfers ownership of a resource from one object to the 
•	next without making a copy. Some classes own resources such as heap memory, file 
•	handles, and so on. When you implement a resource-owning class, you can define a 
•	move constructor and move assignment operator for it. The compiler chooses these 
•	special members during overload resolution in situations where a copy isn't needed. The 
•	Standard Library container types invoke the move constructor on objects if one is 
•	defined. For more information, see Move Constructors and Move Assignment Operators 
•	(C++). 
•	In C-style programming, a function can be passed to another function by using a 
•	function pointer. Function pointers are inconvenient to maintain and understand. The 
•	function they refer to may be defined elsewhere in the source code, far away from the 
•	point at which it's invoked. Also, they're not type-safe. Modern C++ provides function 
•	objects, classes that override the operator() operator, which enables them to be called 
•	like a function. The most convenient way to create function objects is with inline lambda 
•	expressions. The following example shows how to use a lambda expression to pass a 
•	function object, that the find_if function will invoke on each element in the vector: 
•	C++ 
•	S s2("Frank", 3.5); 
•	S s3("Jeri", 85.9); 
•	v.push_back(s1); 
•	v.push_back(s2); 
•	v.push_back(s3); 
•	// Modern C++: 
•	std::vector<S> v2 {s1, s2, s3}; 
•	// or... 
•	std::vector<S> v3{ {"Norah", 2.7}, {"Frank", 3.5}, {"Jeri", 85.9} }; 
•	} 
•	Move semantics 
•	Lambda expressionsThe lambda expression [=](int i) { return i > x && i < y; } can be read as "function 
•	that takes a single argument of type int and returns a boolean that indicates whether 
•	the argument is greater than x and less than y ." Notice that the variables x and y 
•	from the surrounding context can be used in the lambda. The [=] specifies that those 
•	variables are captured by value; in other words, the lambda expression has its own 
•	copies of those values. 
•	Modern C++ emphasizes exceptions, not error codes, as the best way to report and 
•	handle error conditions. For more information, see Modern C++ best practices for 
•	exceptions and error handling. 
•	Use the C++ Standard Library std::atomic struct and related types for inter-thread 
•	communication mechanisms. 
•	Unions are commonly used in C-style programming to conserve memory by enabling 
•	members of different types to occupy the same memory location. However, unions 
•	aren't type-safe and are prone to programming errors. C++17 introduces the 
•	std::variant class as a more robust and safe alternative to unions. The std::visit function 
•	can be used to access the members of a variant type in a type-safe manner.

•	Article • 10/08/2024 
•	The usual starting point for a C++ programmer is a "Hello, world!" application that runs 
•	on the command line. You start with that in this article, and then move on to something 
•	more challenging: a calculator app. 
•	Prerequisites 
•	Visual Studio with the Desktop development with C++ workload installed and 
•	running on your computer. To install it, see Install C++ support in Visual Studio. 
•	This tutorial demonstrates a feature called edit and continue which allows you to 
•	make changes to your code while the app is running. To enable edit and continue, 
•	from the main menu select Tools > Options > Debugging > General and ensure 
•	that Require source files to exactly match the original version is checked. 
•	Create your app project 
•	Visual Studio uses projects to organize the code for an app, and solutions to organize 
•	one or more projects. A project contains all the options, configurations, and rules used 
•	to build an app. It also manages the relationship between all the project's files and any 
•	external files. To create your app, first, create a new project and solution. 
•	1. Start Visual Studio--the Visual Studio Start dialog box appears. Select Create a new 
•	project to get started.2. In the Create a new project dialog, set the language dropdown to C++, set the 
•	platform dropdown to Windows, select Console App from the list of project types, 
•	then select Next. 
•	） Important 
•	Make sure you select the C++ version of the Console App template. It has the 
•	C++, Windows, and Console tags, and the icon has "++" in the corner.3. In the Configure your new project dialog box, select the Project name text box, 
•	name your new project CalculatorTutorial, then select Create. 
•	An empty C++ Windows console application 'Hello World' app is created. Console 
•	applications use a Windows console window to display output and accept user 
•	input. In Visual Studio, an editor window opens and shows the generated code: 
•	C++ 
•	// CalculatorTutorial.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. 
•	Program execution begins and ends there. 
•	// 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	std::cout << "Hello World!\n"; 
•	} 
•	// Run program: Ctrl + F5 or Debug > Start Without Debugging menu 
•	// Debug program: F5 or Debug > Start Debugging menu 
•	// Tips for Getting Started: 
•	// 1. Use the Solution Explorer window to add/manage files 
•	// 2. Use the Team Explorer window to connect to source control 
•	// 3. Use the Output window to see build output and other messages 
•	// 4. Use the Error List window to view errors

•	Project > Add Existing Item to add existing code files to the project// 6. In the future, to open this project again, go to File > Open > 
•	Project and select the .sln file 
•	Verify that your new app builds and runs 
•	The template for a new Windows console application creates a simple C++ "Hello 
•	World" app. At this point, you can see how Visual Studio builds and runs the apps you 
•	create right from the IDE. 
•	1. To build your project, select Build Solution from the Build menu. The Output 
•	window shows the results of the build process. 
•	2. To run the code, on the menu bar, select Debug > Start without debugging 
•	(Ctrl+F5).A console window opens and your app runs within it. 
•	When you start a console app in Visual Studio, it runs your code, then prints "Press 
•	any key to close this window . . ." to give you a chance to see the output. 
•	Congratulations! You created your first "Hello, world!" console app in Visual Studio! 
•	3. Press a key to dismiss the console window and return to Visual Studio. 
•	You now have the tools to build and run your app after every change, to verify that the 
•	code still works as you expect. Later, we show you how to debug it if it doesn't. 
•	Now let's modify the code in this template to be a calculator app. 
•	1. Replace the contents of the CalculatorTutorial.cpp file with the following code so 
•	that it matches this example: 
•	C++ 
•	Edit the code 
•	// CalculatorTutorial.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. 
•	Program execution begins and ends there. 
•	// 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	using namespace std; 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	cout << "Calculator Console Application" << endl << endl; 
•	cout << "Please enter the operation to perform. Format: a+b | a-b |Understanding the code: 
•	The #include statement brings in code in other files. Sometimes, you 
•	may see a filename surrounded by angle brackets like <iostream> . The 
•	angle brackets instruct the compiler to look for the iostream header file 
•	first in the standard system directories, and if not found, to look in 
•	directories specific to the project. Other times, you may see a filename 
•	surrounded by quotes like "someHeader.h" . The quotes instruct the 
•	compiler to skip looking in the standard system directories and instead 
•	only look in directories specific to the project. 
•	The using namespace std; tells the compiler to expect code from the 
•	C++ Standard Library to be used in this file. Without this line, each 
•	keyword from the library would have to be preceded with std:: to 
•	denote its scope. For instance, without that line, each reference to cout 
•	would be written as std::cout . The using statement is added to make it 
•	more convenient to access code in another namespace. 
•	The cout keyword is used to print to standard output in C++. The << 
•	operator tells the compiler to send whatever is to the right of it to the 
•	standard output. 
•	The endl keyword is like the Enter key; it ends the line and moves the 
•	cursor to the next line. It's a better practice to put a \n inside the string 
•	(contained by "" ) to do the same thing because endl always flushes the 
•	buffer which can hurt the performance of the program. But since this is a 
•	very small app, endl is used instead. 
•	All C++ statements must end with semicolons and all C++ applications 
•	must contain a main() function. This function is what the program runs at 
•	a*b | a/b" 
•	<< endl; 
•	return 0; 
•	} 
•	// Run program: Ctrl + F5 or Debug > Start Without Debugging menu 
•	// Debug program: F5 or Debug > Start Debugging menu

•	// 6. In the future, to open this project again, go to File > Open > 
•	Project and select the .sln filethe start. All code must be accessible from main() in order to be used. 
•	2. To save the file, press Ctrl+S, or select the floppy disk icon in the toolbar under the 
•	menu bar. 
•	3. To run the application, press Ctrl+F5 or go to the Debug menu and select Start 
•	Without Debugging. You should see a console window appear that looks like this. 
•	4. Close the console window when you're done. 
•	Add code to do some math 
•	A class is like a blueprint for an object that does something. In this case, we define a 
•	calculator class to contain the math logic. 
•	Add a Calculator class 
•	1. Go to the Project menu and select Add Class. In the Class Name edit box, enter 
•	Calculator. Select OK. 
•	Two new files get added to your project. To save all your changed files at once, 
•	press Ctrl+Shift+S. It's a keyboard shortcut for File > Save All. There's also a 
•	toolbar button for Save All, an icon of two floppy disks, found beside the Savebutton. In general, it's good practice to do Save All frequently, so you don't miss 
•	saving any changes. 
•	The Add Class wizard creates .h and .cpp files that have the same name as the 
•	class. You can see a full list of your project files in the Solution Explorer window, 
•	visible on the side of the IDE. If the window isn't visible, open it from the menu bar 
•	via View > Solution Explorer. 
•	You can open a file by double-clicking it in the Solution Explorer window. Double
•	click Calculator.h to open it. 
•	2. Replace the contents of Calculator.h with the following code so that the file now 
•	looks like this: 
•	C++ 
•	Understanding the code 
•	This code declares a new function called Calculate , which handles math 
•	operations for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
•	#pragma once 
•	class Calculator 
•	{ 
•	public: 
•	double Calculate(double x, char oper, double y); 
•	};C++ code is organized into header ( .h ) files and source ( .cpp ) files. 
•	Some other file extensions are supported by various compilers, but these 
•	are the main ones to know about. Functions and variables are normally 
•	declared, that is, given a name and a type, in header files, and 
•	implemented, or given a definition, in source files. To access code defined 
•	in another file, you can use #include "filename.h" , where filename.h is 
•	the name of the file that declares the variables or functions you want to 
•	use. 
•	It's good practice to organize your code into different files based on what 
•	it does, so it's easy to find the code you need later. In our case, we define 
•	the Calculator class separately from the file containing the main() 
•	function, but we plan to reference the Calculator class in main() . 
•	3. A green squiggle appears under Calculate because although the Calculate 
•	function is declared, it isn't defined. Hover over Calculate , click the down arrow on 
•	the screwdriver icon, and select Create definition of 'Calculate' in Calculator.cpp . 
•	This code is added to Calculator.cpp :Currently, it just returns 0.0. Let's change that. 
•	4. Switch to the Calculator.cpp file in the editor window. Replace the contents of 
•	Calculator::Calculate(double x, char oper, double y) with: 
•	C++ 
•	Understanding the code 
•	The function Calculate takes a number, an operator, and a second 
•	number. Then it performs the requested operation on the two numbers. 
•	The switch statement checks which operator was provided, and executes 
•	the case corresponding to that operation. The default: case is a fallback 
•	double Calculator::Calculate(double x, char oper, double y) 
•	{ 
•	switch(oper) 
•	{ 
•	case '+': 
•	return x + y; 
•	case '-': 
•	return x - y; 
•	case '*': 
•	return x * y; 
•	case '/': 
•	return x / y; 
•	default: 
•	return 0.0; 
•	} 
•	}in case the user types an operator that isn't handled by any of the 
•	preceding case statements. It's best to handle invalid user input in a 
•	more elegant way, but this is beyond the scope of this tutorial. 
•	The double keyword denotes a type of number that supports decimals. 
•	This type of number is called a floating-point number, and double means 
•	a floating point number that has extra precision. This way, the calculator 
•	can handle both decimal math and integer math. The Calculate function 
•	is required to always return a double-precision floating point number due 
•	to the double at the start of the code (this denotes the function's return 
•	type), which is why we return 0.0 in the default case. 
•	The .h file declares the function prototype, which tells the compiler 
•	upfront what parameters it requires, and what return type to expect from 
•	it. The .cpp file has all the implementation details of the function. 
•	If you build and run the code again at this point, it immediately exits after asking which 
•	operation to perform. So, modify the main function to do multiple calculations. 
•	1. Update the main function in CalculatorTutorial.cpp as follows: 
•	C++ 
•	Call the Calculator class member functions 
•	// CalculatorTutorial.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. 
•	Program execution begins and ends there. 
•	// 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	#include "Calculator.h" 
•	using namespace std; 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	double x = 0.0; 
•	double y = 0.0; 
•	double result = 0.0; 
•	char oper = '+'; 
•	cout << "Calculator Console Application" << endl << endl; 
•	cout << "Please enter the operation to perform. Format: a+b | a-b | 
•	a*b | a/b" 
•	<< endl; 
•	Calculator c; 
•	while (true) 
•	{Understanding the code 
•	Since C++ programs always start at the main() function, we need to call 
•	our other code from there, so an #include statement is needed to make 
•	that code visible to our main() function. 
•	The variables x , y , oper , and result are declared to store the first 
•	number, second number, operator, and final result, respectively. It's 
•	always good practice to give them some initial values to avoid undefined 
•	behavior, which is what is done here. 
•	The Calculator c; line declares an object named c as an instance of the 
•	Calculator class. The class itself is just a blueprint for how calculators 
•	work; the object is the specific calculator that does the math. 
•	The while (true) statement is a loop. The code inside the loop executes 
•	over and over again as long as the condition inside the () holds true. 
•	Since the condition is simply listed as true , it's always true, so the loop 
•	runs forever. To close the program, the user must manually close the 
•	console window. Otherwise, the program always waits for new input. 
•	The cin keyword accepts input from the user. The input stream is smart 
•	enough to process a line of text entered in the console window and place 
•	it inside each of the variables listed, in order. 
•	The c.Calculate(x, oper, y); expression calls the Calculate function 
•	defined earlier, and supplies the entered input values and the requested 
•	operation. The function then returns a number that is stored in result . 
•	Finally, result is printed to the console and the user sees the result of 
•	the calculation. 
•	Now test the program again to make sure everything works properly. 
•	1. Press Ctrl+F5 to rebuild and start the app. 
•	2. Enter 5+5 , and press Enter. Verify that the result is 10. 
•	cin >> x >> oper >> y; 
•	result = c.Calculate(x, oper, y); 
•	cout << "Result " << "of " << x << oper << y << " is: " << 
•	result << endl; 
•	} 
•	return 0; 
•	} 
•	Build and test the code again3. Stop the program by closing the console window. 
•	Debug the app 
•	Since the user is free to type anything into the console window, let's make sure the 
•	calculator handles unexpected input. Instead of running the program, let's debug it so 
•	we can inspect what it's doing step-by-step. 
•	Run the app in the debugger 
•	1. In CalcuatorTutorial.cpp , set a breakpoint on the line: result = c.Calculate(x, 
•	oper, y); . To set the breakpoint, click next to the line in the gray vertical bar along 
•	the left edge of the editor window so that a red dot appears. 
•	Now when we debug the program, execution pauses at that line. We already have 
•	a rough idea that the program works for simple cases. Since we don't want to 
•	pause execution every time we call Calculate() , let's make the breakpoint 
•	conditional.2. Right-click the red dot that represents the breakpoint, and select Conditions. In 
•	the edit box for the condition, enter (y == 0) && (oper == '/') . Select the Close 
•	button to save the breakpoint condition. 
•	Now, execution pauses at the breakpoint when the app tries to divide by 0. 
•	3. To debug the program, press F5, or select the Local Windows Debugger debugger 
•	toolbar button that has the green arrow icon. In your console app, if you enter 
•	something like "5 - 0", the program behaves normally and keeps running. 
•	However, if you type "10 / 0", it pauses at the breakpoint. You can put any number 
•	of spaces between the operator and numbers: cin is smart enough to parse the 
•	input appropriately.Useful windows in the debugger 
•	When you debug your code, you may notice that some new windows appear. These 
•	windows can assist your debugging experience. Take a look at the Autos window. The 
•	Autos window shows you the current values of variables used at least three lines before 
•	and up to the current line. If you don't see the Autos window, from the main menu 
•	select Debug > Windows > Autos. 
•	To see all of the variables from that function, switch to the Locals window. Because this 
•	is a small function, the Autos and Locals window show the same variables. But you can 
•	modify the values of these variables in the Locals window while debugging to see what 
•	effect they would have on the program. In this case, we leave them alone. Open the 
•	Locals window by selecting Locals at the bottom of the Autos window, or by selecting 
•	from the main menu Debug > Windows > Locals.You can also hover over variables in the code to see their current values at the point 
•	where execution is currently paused. Make sure the editor window is in focus by clicking 
•	on it first. 
•	Continue debugging 
•	1. The yellow arrow on the left shows the current point of execution. The current line 
•	calls Calculate , so press F11 to Step Into the function. Now you're executing code 
•	in the body of the Calculate function. Be careful with Step Into because it steps 
•	into any functions on the line you're on, including standard library functions. It's 
•	fine to step into the standard library, but you may be more interested in focusing 
•	on your code instead of library code. 
•	2. Now that the point of execution is at the start of the Calculate function, press F10 
•	to move to the next line in the program's execution. F10 is also known as Step 
•	Over. You can use Step Over to move from line to line, without delving into the 
•	details of what is occurring in each part of the line. In general, you should use Step 
•	Over instead of Step Into unless you want to dive more deeply into code that is 
•	being called from elsewhere (as you did to reach the body of Calculate ). 
•	3. Continue using F10 to Step Over each line until you get back to the main() 
•	function in the other file, and stop on the cout line.The program is doing what's expected: it takes the first number, and divides it by 
•	the second. On the cout line, hover over the result variable or take a look at 
•	result in the Autos window. Its value is inf , which doesn't look right. 
•	Let's fix it. The cout line outputs whatever value is stored in result , so when you 
•	step one more line forward using F10, the console window displays: 
•	This result is because division by zero is undefined, so the program doesn't have a 
•	numerical answer for the requested operation. 
•	Fix the "divide by zero" error 
•	Let's handle division by zero more gracefully so that it's easier for the user to 
•	understand the problem. 
•	1. Make the following changes in CalculatorTutorial.cpp . You can leave the 
•	program running as you edit, thanks to a debugger feature called Edit andContinue. Add an if statement following cin >> x >> oper >> y; to check for 
•	division by zero and output a message to the user if it happens. Otherwise, the 
•	result is printed. 
•	C++ 
•	2. Press F5 once. Program execution continues until it has to pause to ask for user 
•	input. Enter 10 / 0 again. Now, a more helpful message is printed. The user is 
•	asked for more input, and the program continues executing normally. 
•	// CalculatorTutorial.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. 
•	Program execution begins and ends there. 
•	// 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	#include "Calculator.h" 
•	using namespace std; 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	double x = 0.0; 
•	double y = 0.0; 
•	double result = 0.0; 
•	char oper = '+'; 
•	cout << "Calculator Console Application" << endl << endl; 
•	cout << "Please enter the operation to perform. Format: a+b | a-b | 
•	a*b | a/b" << endl; 
•	Calculator c; 
•	while (true) 
•	{ 
•	cin >> x >> oper >> y; 
•	if (oper == '/' && y == 0) 
•	{ 
•	cout << "Math error: Attempted to divide by zero!" << endl; 
•	continue; 
•	} 
•	else 
•	{ 
•	result = c.Calculate(x, oper, y); 
•	} 
•	cout << "Result " << "of " << x << oper << y << " is: " << 
•	result << endl; 
•	} 
•	return 0; 
•	}７ Note 
•	When you edit code while in debugging mode, there's a risk of code 
•	becoming stale. This happens when the debugger is still running your old 
•	code, and has not yet updated it with your changes. The debugger displays a 
•	dialog to inform you when this happens. Sometimes, you may need to press 
•	F5 to refresh the code being executed. In particular, if you make a change 
•	inside a function while the point of execution is inside that function, you need 
•	to step out of the function, then back into it again to get the updated code. If 
•	that doesn't work and you see an error message, you can stop debugging by 
•	clicking on the red square in the toolbar under the menus at the top of the 
•	IDE, then start debugging again by entering F5 or by choosing the green 
•	"play" arrow beside the stop button on the toolbar. 
•	Another reason edit and continue may fail is if you see a message that says 
•	"The Require source files to exactly match the original version setting under 
•	Debug->Options->General needs to be enabled..." To fix this, from the main 
•	menu select Tools > Options > Debugging > General and ensure that 
•	Require source files to exactly match the original version is checked. 
•	Understanding the Run and Debug shortcuts 
•	F5, or Debug > Start Debugging, starts a debugging session, if one isn't 
•	already active, and runs the program until a breakpoint is hit or the 
•	program needs user input. If no user input is needed and no breakpoint 
•	is available to hit, the program terminates and the console window closes 
•	itself when the program finishes running. If your program outputs to the 
•	console, use Ctrl+F5 or set a breakpoint before you press F5 to keep the 
•	window open. 
•	Ctrl+F5, or Debug > Start Without Debugging, runs the application 
•	without going into debug mode. This is slightly faster than debugging, 
•	and the console window stays open after the program finishes executing. 
•	F10, known as Step Over, lets you iterate through code, line-by-line, and 
•	visualize how the code is run and what variable values are at each step of 
•	execution.F11, known as Step Into, works similarly to Step Over, except it steps into 
•	any functions called on the line of execution. For example, if the line 
•	being executed calls a function, pressing F11 moves the pointer into the 
•	body of the function, so you can follow the function's code being run 
•	before coming back to the line you started at. Pressing F10 steps over the 
•	function call and just moves to the next line; the function call still 
•	happens, but the program doesn't pause to show you what it's doing. 
•	Close the app 
•	If it's still running, close the console window to stop the calculator app. 
•	Add Git source control 
•	Now that you've created an app, you might want to add it to a Git repository. We've got 
•	you covered. Visual Studio makes that process easy with Git tools you can use directly 
•	from the IDE. 
•	 Tip 
•	Git is the most widely used modern version control system, so whether you're a 
•	professional developer or you're learning how to code, Git can be very useful. If 
•	you're new to Git, the https://git-scm.com/ website is a good place to start. 
•	There, you can find cheat sheets, a popular online book, and Git Basics videos. 
•	To associate your code with Git, you start by creating a new Git repository where your 
•	code is located. Here's how: 
•	1. In the status bar at the bottom-right corner of Visual Studio, select Add to Source 
•	Control, and then select Git. 
•	2. In the Create a Git repository dialog box, sign in to GitHub.The repository name auto-populates based on your folder location. By default, 
•	your new repository is private, which means you're the only one who can access it. 
•	 Tip 
•	Whether your repository is public or private, it's best to have a remote backup 
•	of your code stored securely on GitHub. Even if you aren't working with a 
•	team, a remote repository makes your code available to you from any 
•	computer. 
•	3. Select Create and Push. 
•	After you create your repository, status details appear in the status bar. 
•	The first icon with the arrows shows how many outgoing/incoming commits are in 
•	your current branch. You can use this icon to pull any incoming commits or push 
•	any outgoing commits. You can also choose to view these commits first. To do so, 
•	select the icon, and then select View Outgoing/Incoming.Feedback 
•	Was this page helpful? 
•	Provide product feedback 
•	| Get help at Microsoft Q&A 
•	The second icon with the pencil shows the number of uncommitted changes to 
•	your code. You can select this icon to view those changes in the Git Changes 
•	window. 
•	To learn more about how to use Git with your app, see the Visual Studio version control 
•	documentation. 
•	Congratulations! You completed the code for the calculator app, built and debugged it, 
•	and added it to a repo, all in Visual Studio.

•	Let's take the short code example above piece by piece, and explain what's going on in 
•	each part. 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	With the default project settings, the included headers come from the Windows SDK, 
•	inside the folder 
•	%WindowsSdkDir%Include<WindowsTargetPlatformVersion>\cppwinrt\winrt . Visual Studio

•	#include <winrt/Windows.Web.Syndication.h> 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	// main.cpp 
•	#include "pch.h" 
•	using namespace winrt; 
•	using namespace Windows::Foundation;

•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	winrt::init_apartment(); 
•	Uri rssFeedUri{ L"https://blogs.windows.com/feed" }; 
•	SyndicationClient syndicationClient; 
•	syndicationClient.SetRequestHeader(L"User-Agent", L"Mozilla/5.0 
•	(compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; Trident/6.0)"); 
•	SyndicationFeed syndicationFeed = 
•	syndicationClient.RetrieveFeedAsync(rssFeedUri).get(); 
•	for (const SyndicationItem syndicationItem : syndicationFeed.Items()) 
•	{ 
•	winrt::hstring titleAsHstring = syndicationItem.Title().Text(); 
•	// A workaround to remove the trademark symbol from the title 
•	string, because it causes issues in this case. 
•	std::wstring titleAsStdWstring{ titleAsHstring.c_str() }; 
•	titleAsStdWstring.erase(remove(titleAsStdWstring.begin(), 
•	titleAsStdWstring.end(), L'™'), titleAsStdWstring.end()); 
•	titleAsHstring = titleAsStdWstring; 
•	std::wcout << titleAsHstring.c_str() << std::endl; 
•	} 
•	} 
•	#include <winrt/Windows.Foundation.Collections.h> 
•	#include <winrt/Windows.Web.Syndication.h>Windows SDK, because your project (via the cppwinrt.exe tool) generates those same 
•	headers into your project's $(GeneratedFilesDir) folder. They'll be loaded from that 
•	folder if they can't be found elsewhere, or if you change your project settings. 
•	The headers contain Windows APIs projected into C++/WinRT. In other words, for each 
•	Windows type, C++/WinRT defines a C++-friendly equivalent (called the projected type). 
•	A projected type has the same fully-qualified name as the Windows type, but it's placed 
•	in the C++ winrt namespace. Putting these includes in your precompiled header 
•	reduces incremental build times. 
•	） Important 
•	Whenever you want to use a type from a Windows namespaces, you must #include 
•	the corresponding C++/WinRT Windows namespace header file, as shown above. 
•	The corresponding header is the one with the same name as the type's namespace. 
•	For example, to use the C++/WinRT projection for the 
•	Windows::Foundation::Collections::PropertySet runtime class, include the 
•	winrt/Windows.Foundation.Collections.h header. 
•	It is common for a C++/WinRT projection header to automatically include related 
•	namespace header files. For example, winrt/Windows.Foundation.Collections.h 
•	includes winrt/Windows.Foundation.h . But you shouldn't rely on this behavior, since 
•	it's an implementation detail that changes over time. You must explicitly include 
•	any headers that you need. 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	using namespace winrt; 
•	using namespace Windows::Foundation; 
•	using namespace Windows::Web::Syndication; 
•	The using namespace directives are optional, but convenient. The pattern shown above 
•	for such directives (allowing unqualified name lookup for anything in the winrt 
•	namespace) is suitable for when you're beginning a new project and C++/WinRT is the 
•	only language projection you're using inside of that project. If, on the other hand, you're 
•	mixing C++/WinRT code with C++/CX and/or SDK application binary interface (ABI) 
•	code (you're either porting from, or interoperating with, one or both of those models), 
•	then see the topics Interop between C++/WinRT and C++/CX, Move to C++/WinRT 
•	from C++/CX, and Interop between C++/WinRT and the ABI. 
•	C++/WinRTwinrt::init_apartment(); 
•	The call to winrt::init_apartment initializes the thread in the Windows Runtime; by 
•	default, in a multithreaded apartment. The call also initializes COM. 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	Uri rssFeedUri{ L"https://blogs.windows.com/feed" }; 
•	SyndicationClient syndicationClient; 
•	Stack-allocate two objects: they represent the uri of the Windows blog, and a 
•	syndication client. We construct the uri with a simple wide string literal (see String 
•	handling in C++/WinRT for more ways you can work with strings). 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	SyndicationFeed syndicationFeed = 
•	syndicationClient.RetrieveFeedAsync(rssFeedUri).get(); 
•	SyndicationClient::RetrieveFeedAsync is an example of an asynchronous Windows 
•	Runtime function. The code example receives an asynchronous operation object from 
•	RetrieveFeedAsync, and it calls get on that object to block the calling thread and wait 
•	for the result (which is a syndication feed, in this case). For more about concurrency, and 
•	for non-blocking techniques, see Concurrency and asynchronous operations with 
•	C++/WinRT. 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	for (const SyndicationItem syndicationItem : syndicationFeed.Items()) { ... 
•	} 
•	SyndicationFeed.Items is a range, defined by the iterators returned from begin and end 
•	functions (or their constant, reverse, and constant-reverse variants). Because of this, you 
•	can enumerate Items with either a range-based for statement, or with the std::for_each 
•	template function. Whenever you iterate over a Windows Runtime collection like this, 
•	you'll need to #include <winrt/Windows.Foundation.Collections.h> . 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	winrt::hstring titleAsHstring = syndicationItem.Title().Text(); 
•	// Omitted: there's a little bit of extra work here to remove the trademark 
•	symbol from the title text.std::wcout << titleAsHstring.c_str() << std::endl; 
•	Gets the feed's title text, as a winrt::hstring object (more details in String handling in 
•	C++/WinRT). The hstring is then output, via the c_str function, which reflects the pattern 
•	used with C++ Standard Library strings. 
•	As you can see, C++/WinRT encourages modern, and class-like, C++ expressions such 
•	as syndicationItem.Title().Text() . This is a different, and cleaner, programming style 
•	from traditional COM programming. You don't need to directly initialize COM, nor work 
•	with COM pointers. 
•	Nor do you need to handle HRESULT return codes. C++/WinRT converts error HRESULTs 
•	to exceptions such as winrt::hresult-error for a natural and modern programming style. 
•	For more info about error-handling, and code examples, see Error handling with 
•	C++/WinRT. 
•	Modify a Windows Desktop application project 
•	to add C++/WinRT support 
•	Some desktop projects (for example, the WinUI 3 templates in Visual Studio) have 
•	C++/WinRT support built in. 
•	But this section shows you how you can add C++/WinRT support to any Windows 
•	Desktop application project that you might have. If you don't have an existing Windows 
•	Desktop application project, then you can follow along with these steps by first creating 
•	one. For example, open Visual Studio and create a Visual C++ > Windows Desktop > 
•	Windows Desktop Application project. 
•	You can optionally install the C++/WinRT Visual Studio Extension (VSIX) and the 
•	NuGet package. For details, see Visual Studio support for C++/WinRT. 
•	Set project properties 
•	Go to project property General > Windows SDK Version, and select All Configurations 
•	and All Platforms. Ensure that Windows SDK Version is set to 10.0.17134.0 (Windows 
•	10, version 1803) or greater. 
•	Confirm that you're not affected by Why won't my new project compile?. 
•	Because C++/WinRT uses features from the C++17 standard, set project property 
•	C/C++ > Language > C++ Language Standard to ISO C++17 Standard (/std:c++17).The precompiled header 
•	The default project template creates a precompiled header for you, named either 
•	framework.h , or stdafx.h . Rename that to pch.h . If you have a stdafx.cpp file, then 
•	rename that to pch.cpp . Set project property C/C++ > Precompiled Headers > 
•	Precompiled Header to Create (/Yc), and Precompiled Header File to pch.h. 
•	Find and replace all #include "framework.h" (or #include "stdafx.h" ) with #include 
•	"pch.h" . 
•	In pch.h , include winrt/base.h .

•	Linking 
•	The C++/WinRT language projection depends on certain Windows Runtime free (non
•	member) functions, and entry points, that require linking to the WindowsApp.lib 
•	umbrella library. This section describes three ways of satisfying the linker. 
•	The first option is to add to your Visual Studio project all of the C++/WinRT MSBuild 
•	properties and targets. To do this, install the Microsoft.Windows.CppWinRT NuGet 
•	package into your project. Open the project in Visual Studio, click Project > Manage 
•	NuGet Packages... > Browse, type or paste Microsoft.Windows.CppWinRT in the search 
•	box, select the item in search results, and then click Install to install the package for that 
•	project. 
•	You can also use project link settings to explicitly link WindowsApp.lib . Or, you can do it 
•	in source code (in pch.h , for example) like this. 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	#pragma comment(lib, "windowsapp") 
•	You can now compile and link, and add C++/WinRT code to your project (for example, 
•	code similar to that shown in the A C++/WinRT quick-start section, above). 
•	The three main scenarios for C++/WinRTAs you use and become familiar with C++/WinRT, and work through the rest of the 
•	documentation here, you'll likely notice that there are three main scenarios, as described 
•	in the following sections. 
•	Consuming Windows APIs and types 
•	In other words, using, or calling APIs. For example, making API calls to communicate 
•	using Bluetooth; to stream and present video; to integrate with the Windows shell; and 
•	so on. C++/WinRT fully and uncompromisingly supports this category of scenario. For 
•	more info, see Consume APIs with C++/WinRT. 
•	Authoring Windows APIs and types 
•	In other words, producing APIs and types. For example, producing the kinds of APIs 
•	described in the section above; or the graphics APIs; the storage and file system APIs; 
•	the networking APIs, and so on. For more info, see Author APIs with C++/WinRT. 
•	Authoring APIs with C++/WinRT is a little more involved than consuming them, because 
•	you must use IDL to define the shape of the API before you can implement it. There's a 
•	walkthrough of doing that in XAML controls; bind to a C++/WinRT property. 
•	XAML applications 
•	This scenario is about building applications and controls on the XAML UI framework. 
•	Working in a XAML application amounts to a combination of consuming and authoring. 
•	But since XAML is the dominant UI framework on Windows today, and its influence over 
•	the Windows Runtime is proportionate to that, it deserves its own category of scenario. 
•	Be aware that XAML works best with programming languages that offer reflection. In 
•	C++/WinRT, you sometimes have to do a little extra work in order to interoperate with 
•	the XAML framework. All of those cases are covered in the documentation. Good places 
•	to start are XAML controls; bind to a C++/WinRT property and XAML custom 
•	(templated) controls with C++/WinRT.

•	Article • 10/08/2024 
•	The usual starting point for a C++ programmer is a "Hello, world!" application that runs 
•	on the command line. You start with that in this article, and then move on to something 
•	more challenging: a calculator app. 
•	Prerequisites 
•	Visual Studio with the Desktop development with C++ workload installed and 
•	running on your computer. To install it, see Install C++ support in Visual Studio. 
•	This tutorial demonstrates a feature called edit and continue which allows you to 
•	make changes to your code while the app is running. To enable edit and continue, 
•	from the main menu select Tools > Options > Debugging > General and ensure 
•	that Require source files to exactly match the original version is checked. 
•	Create your app project 
•	Visual Studio uses projects to organize the code for an app, and solutions to organize 
•	one or more projects. A project contains all the options, configurations, and rules used 
•	to build an app. It also manages the relationship between all the project's files and any 
•	external files. To create your app, first, create a new project and solution. 
•	1. Start Visual Studio--the Visual Studio Start dialog box appears. Select Create a new 
•	project to get started.2. In the Create a new project dialog, set the language dropdown to C++, set the 
•	platform dropdown to Windows, select Console App from the list of project types, 
•	then select Next. 
•	） Important 
•	Make sure you select the C++ version of the Console App template. It has the 
•	C++, Windows, and Console tags, and the icon has "++" in the corner.3. In the Configure your new project dialog box, select the Project name text box, 
•	name your new project CalculatorTutorial, then select Create. 
•	An empty C++ Windows console application 'Hello World' app is created. Console 
•	applications use a Windows console window to display output and accept user 
•	input. In Visual Studio, an editor window opens and shows the generated code: 
•	C++ 
•	// CalculatorTutorial.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. 
•	Program execution begins and ends there. 
•	// 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	std::cout << "Hello World!\n"; 
•	} 
•	// Run program: Ctrl + F5 or Debug > Start Without Debugging menu 
•	// Debug program: F5 or Debug > Start Debugging menu 
•	// Tips for Getting Started: 
•	// 1. Use the Solution Explorer window to add/manage files 
•	// 2. Use the Team Explorer window to connect to source control 
•	// 3. Use the Output window to see build output and other messages 
•	// 4. Use the Error List window to view errors 
•	// 5. Go to Project > Add New Item to create new code files, or 
•	Project > Add Existing Item to add existing code files to the project// 6. In the future, to open this project again, go to File > Open > 
•	Project and select the .sln file 
•	Verify that your new app builds and runs 
•	The template for a new Windows console application creates a simple C++ "Hello 
•	World" app. At this point, you can see how Visual Studio builds and runs the apps you 
•	create right from the IDE. 
•	1. To build your project, select Build Solution from the Build menu. The Output 
•	window shows the results of the build process. 
•	2. To run the code, on the menu bar, select Debug > Start without debugging 
•	(Ctrl+F5).A console window opens and your app runs within it. 
•	When you start a console app in Visual Studio, it runs your code, then prints "Press 
•	any key to close this window . . ." to give you a chance to see the output. 
•	Congratulations! You created your first "Hello, world!" console app in Visual Studio! 
•	3. Press a key to dismiss the console window and return to Visual Studio. 
•	You now have the tools to build and run your app after every change, to verify that the 
•	code still works as you expect. Later, we show you how to debug it if it doesn't. 
•	Now let's modify the code in this template to be a calculator app. 
•	1. Replace the contents of the CalculatorTutorial.cpp file with the following code so 
•	that it matches this example: 
•	C++ 
•	Edit the code 
•	// CalculatorTutorial.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. 
•	Program execution begins and ends there. 
•	// 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	using namespace std; 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	cout << "Calculator Console Application" << endl << endl; 
•	cout << "Please enter the operation to perform. Format: a+b | a-b |Understanding the code: 
•	The #include statement brings in code in other files. Sometimes, you 
•	may see a filename surrounded by angle brackets like <iostream> . The 
•	angle brackets instruct the compiler to look for the iostream header file 
•	first in the standard system directories, and if not found, to look in 
•	directories specific to the project. Other times, you may see a filename 
•	surrounded by quotes like "someHeader.h" . The quotes instruct the 
•	compiler to skip looking in the standard system directories and instead 
•	only look in directories specific to the project. 
•	The using namespace std; tells the compiler to expect code from the 
•	C++ Standard Library to be used in this file. Without this line, each 
•	keyword from the library would have to be preceded with std:: to 
•	denote its scope. For instance, without that line, each reference to cout 
•	would be written as std::cout . The using statement is added to make it 
•	more convenient to access code in another namespace. 
•	The cout keyword is used to print to standard output in C++. The << 
•	operator tells the compiler to send whatever is to the right of it to the 
•	standard output. 
•	The endl keyword is like the Enter key; it ends the line and moves the 
•	cursor to the next line. It's a better practice to put a \n inside the string 
•	(contained by "" ) to do the same thing because endl always flushes the 
•	buffer which can hurt the performance of the program. But since this is a 
•	very small app, endl is used instead. 
•	All C++ statements must end with semicolons and all C++ applications 
•	must contain a main() function. This function is what the program runs at 
•	a*b | a/b" 
•	<< endl; 
•	return 0; 
•	} 
•	// Run program: Ctrl + F5 or Debug > Start Without Debugging menu 
•	// Debug program: F5 or Debug > Start Debugging menu 
•	// Tips for Getting Started: 
•	// 1. Use the Solution Explorer window to add/manage files 
•	// 2. Use the Team Explorer window to connect to source control 
•	// 3. Use the Output window to see build output and other messages 
•	// 4. Use the Error List window to view errors 
•	// 5. Go to Project > Add New Item to create new code files, or 
•	Project > Add Existing Item to add existing code files to the project 
•	// 6. In the future, to open this project again, go to File > Open > 
•	Project and select the .sln filethe start. All code must be accessible from main() in order to be used. 
•	2. To save the file, press Ctrl+S, or select the floppy disk icon in the toolbar under the 
•	menu bar. 
•	3. To run the application, press Ctrl+F5 or go to the Debug menu and select Start 
•	Without Debugging. You should see a console window appear that looks like this. 
•	4. Close the console window when you're done. 
•	Add code to do some math 
•	A class is like a blueprint for an object that does something. In this case, we define a 
•	calculator class to contain the math logic. 
•	Add a Calculator class 
•	1. Go to the Project menu and select Add Class. In the Class Name edit box, enter 
•	Calculator. Select OK. 
•	Two new files get added to your project. To save all your changed files at once, 
•	press Ctrl+Shift+S. It's a keyboard shortcut for File > Save All. There's also a 
•	toolbar button for Save All, an icon of two floppy disks, found beside the Savebutton. In general, it's good practice to do Save All frequently, so you don't miss 
•	saving any changes. 
•	The Add Class wizard creates .h and .cpp files that have the same name as the 
•	class. You can see a full list of your project files in the Solution Explorer window, 
•	visible on the side of the IDE. If the window isn't visible, open it from the menu bar 
•	via View > Solution Explorer. 
•	You can open a file by double-clicking it in the Solution Explorer window. Double
•	click Calculator.h to open it. 
•	2. Replace the contents of Calculator.h with the following code so that the file now 
•	looks like this: 
•	C++ 
•	Understanding the code 
•	This code declares a new function called Calculate , which handles math 
•	operations for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
•	#pragma once 
•	class Calculator 
•	{ 
•	public: 
•	double Calculate(double x, char oper, double y); 
•	};C++ code is organized into header ( .h ) files and source ( .cpp ) files. 
•	Some other file extensions are supported by various compilers, but these 
•	are the main ones to know about. Functions and variables are normally 
•	declared, that is, given a name and a type, in header files, and 
•	implemented, or given a definition, in source files. To access code defined 
•	in another file, you can use #include "filename.h" , where filename.h is 
•	the name of the file that declares the variables or functions you want to 
•	use. 
•	It's good practice to organize your code into different files based on what 
•	it does, so it's easy to find the code you need later. In our case, we define 
•	the Calculator class separately from the file containing the main() 
•	function, but we plan to reference the Calculator class in main() . 
•	3. A green squiggle appears under Calculate because although the Calculate 
•	function is declared, it isn't defined. Hover over Calculate , click the down arrow on 
•	the screwdriver icon, and select Create definition of 'Calculate' in Calculator.cpp . 
•	This code is added to Calculator.cpp :Currently, it just returns 0.0. Let's change that. 
•	4. Switch to the Calculator.cpp file in the editor window. Replace the contents of 
•	Calculator::Calculate(double x, char oper, double y) with: 
•	C++ 
•	Understanding the code 
•	The function Calculate takes a number, an operator, and a second 
•	number. Then it performs the requested operation on the two numbers. 
•	The switch statement checks which operator was provided, and executes 
•	the case corresponding to that operation. The default: case is a fallback 
•	double Calculator::Calculate(double x, char oper, double y) 
•	{ 
•	switch(oper) 
•	{ 
•	case '+': 
•	return x + y; 
•	case '-': 
•	return x - y; 
•	case '*': 
•	return x * y; 
•	case '/': 
•	return x / y; 
•	default: 
•	return 0.0; 
•	} 
•	}in case the user types an operator that isn't handled by any of the 
•	preceding case statements. It's best to handle invalid user input in a 
•	more elegant way, but this is beyond the scope of this tutorial. 
•	The double keyword denotes a type of number that supports decimals. 
•	This type of number is called a floating-point number, and double means 
•	a floating point number that has extra precision. This way, the calculator 
•	can handle both decimal math and integer math. The Calculate function 
•	is required to always return a double-precision floating point number due 
•	to the double at the start of the code (this denotes the function's return 
•	type), which is why we return 0.0 in the default case. 
•	The .h file declares the function prototype, which tells the compiler 
•	upfront what parameters it requires, and what return type to expect from 
•	it. The .cpp file has all the implementation details of the function. 
•	If you build and run the code again at this point, it immediately exits after asking which 
•	operation to perform. So, modify the main function to do multiple calculations. 
•	1. Update the main function in CalculatorTutorial.cpp as follows: 
•	C++ 
•	Call the Calculator class member functions 
•	// CalculatorTutorial.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. 
•	Program execution begins and ends there. 
•	// 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	#include "Calculator.h" 
•	using namespace std; 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	double x = 0.0; 
•	double y = 0.0; 
•	double result = 0.0; 
•	char oper = '+'; 
•	cout << "Calculator Console Application" << endl << endl; 
•	cout << "Please enter the operation to perform. Format: a+b | a-b | 
•	a*b | a/b" 
•	<< endl; 
•	Calculator c; 
•	while (true) 
•	{Understanding the code 
•	Since C++ programs always start at the main() function, we need to call 
•	our other code from there, so an #include statement is needed to make 
•	that code visible to our main() function. 
•	The variables x , y , oper , and result are declared to store the first 
•	number, second number, operator, and final result, respectively. It's 
•	always good practice to give them some initial values to avoid undefined 
•	behavior, which is what is done here. 
•	The Calculator c; line declares an object named c as an instance of the 
•	Calculator class. The class itself is just a blueprint for how calculators 
•	work; the object is the specific calculator that does the math. 
•	The while (true) statement is a loop. The code inside the loop executes 
•	over and over again as long as the condition inside the () holds true. 
•	Since the condition is simply listed as true , it's always true, so the loop 
•	runs forever. To close the program, the user must manually close the 
•	console window. Otherwise, the program always waits for new input. 
•	The cin keyword accepts input from the user. The input stream is smart 
•	enough to process a line of text entered in the console window and place 
•	it inside each of the variables listed, in order. 
•	The c.Calculate(x, oper, y); expression calls the Calculate function 
•	defined earlier, and supplies the entered input values and the requested 
•	operation. The function then returns a number that is stored in result . 
•	Finally, result is printed to the console and the user sees the result of 
•	the calculation. 
•	Now test the program again to make sure everything works properly. 
•	1. Press Ctrl+F5 to rebuild and start the app. 
•	2. Enter 5+5 , and press Enter. Verify that the result is 10. 
•	cin >> x >> oper >> y; 
•	result = c.Calculate(x, oper, y); 
•	cout << "Result " << "of " << x << oper << y << " is: " << 
•	result << endl; 
•	} 
•	return 0; 
•	} 
•	Build and test the code again3. Stop the program by closing the console window. 
•	Debug the app 
•	Since the user is free to type anything into the console window, let's make sure the 
•	calculator handles unexpected input. Instead of running the program, let's debug it so 
•	we can inspect what it's doing step-by-step. 
•	Run the app in the debugger 
•	1. In CalcuatorTutorial.cpp , set a breakpoint on the line: result = c.Calculate(x, 
•	oper, y); . To set the breakpoint, click next to the line in the gray vertical bar along 
•	the left edge of the editor window so that a red dot appears. 
•	Now when we debug the program, execution pauses at that line. We already have 
•	a rough idea that the program works for simple cases. Since we don't want to 
•	pause execution every time we call Calculate() , let's make the breakpoint 
•	conditional.2. Right-click the red dot that represents the breakpoint, and select Conditions. In 
•	the edit box for the condition, enter (y == 0) && (oper == '/') . Select the Close 
•	button to save the breakpoint condition. 
•	Now, execution pauses at the breakpoint when the app tries to divide by 0. 
•	3. To debug the program, press F5, or select the Local Windows Debugger debugger 
•	toolbar button that has the green arrow icon. In your console app, if you enter 
•	something like "5 - 0", the program behaves normally and keeps running. 
•	However, if you type "10 / 0", it pauses at the breakpoint. You can put any number 
•	of spaces between the operator and numbers: cin is smart enough to parse the 
•	input appropriately.Useful windows in the debugger 
•	When you debug your code, you may notice that some new windows appear. These 
•	windows can assist your debugging experience. Take a look at the Autos window. The 
•	Autos window shows you the current values of variables used at least three lines before 
•	and up to the current line. If you don't see the Autos window, from the main menu 
•	select Debug > Windows > Autos. 
•	To see all of the variables from that function, switch to the Locals window. Because this 
•	is a small function, the Autos and Locals window show the same variables. But you can 
•	modify the values of these variables in the Locals window while debugging to see what 
•	effect they would have on the program. In this case, we leave them alone. Open the 
•	Locals window by selecting Locals at the bottom of the Autos window, or by selecting 
•	from the main menu Debug > Windows > Locals.You can also hover over variables in the code to see their current values at the point 
•	where execution is currently paused. Make sure the editor window is in focus by clicking 
•	on it first. 
•	Continue debugging 
•	1. The yellow arrow on the left shows the current point of execution. The current line 
•	calls Calculate , so press F11 to Step Into the function. Now you're executing code 
•	in the body of the Calculate function. Be careful with Step Into because it steps 
•	into any functions on the line you're on, including standard library functions. It's 
•	fine to step into the standard library, but you may be more interested in focusing 
•	on your code instead of library code. 
•	2. Now that the point of execution is at the start of the Calculate function, press F10 
•	to move to the next line in the program's execution. F10 is also known as Step 
•	Over. You can use Step Over to move from line to line, without delving into the 
•	details of what is occurring in each part of the line. In general, you should use Step 
•	Over instead of Step Into unless you want to dive more deeply into code that is 
•	being called from elsewhere (as you did to reach the body of Calculate ). 
•	3. Continue using F10 to Step Over each line until you get back to the main() 
•	function in the other file, and stop on the cout line.The program is doing what's expected: it takes the first number, and divides it by 
•	the second. On the cout line, hover over the result variable or take a look at 
•	result in the Autos window. Its value is inf , which doesn't look right. 
•	Let's fix it. The cout line outputs whatever value is stored in result , so when you 
•	step one more line forward using F10, the console window displays: 
•	This result is because division by zero is undefined, so the program doesn't have a 
•	numerical answer for the requested operation. 
•	Fix the "divide by zero" error 
•	Let's handle division by zero more gracefully so that it's easier for the user to 
•	understand the problem. 
•	1. Make the following changes in CalculatorTutorial.cpp . You can leave the 
•	program running as you edit, thanks to a debugger feature called Edit andContinue. Add an if statement following cin >> x >> oper >> y; to check for 
•	division by zero and output a message to the user if it happens. Otherwise, the 
•	result is printed. 
•	C++ 
•	2. Press F5 once. Program execution continues until it has to pause to ask for user 
•	input. Enter 10 / 0 again. Now, a more helpful message is printed. The user is 
•	asked for more input, and the program continues executing normally. 
•	// CalculatorTutorial.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. 
•	Program execution begins and ends there. 
•	// 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	#include "Calculator.h" 
•	using namespace std; 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	double x = 0.0; 
•	double y = 0.0; 
•	double result = 0.0; 
•	char oper = '+'; 
•	cout << "Calculator Console Application" << endl << endl; 
•	cout << "Please enter the operation to perform. Format: a+b | a-b | 
•	a*b | a/b" << endl; 
•	Calculator c; 
•	while (true) 
•	{ 
•	cin >> x >> oper >> y; 
•	if (oper == '/' && y == 0) 
•	{ 
•	cout << "Math error: Attempted to divide by zero!" << endl; 
•	continue; 
•	} 
•	else 
•	{ 
•	result = c.Calculate(x, oper, y); 
•	} 
•	cout << "Result " << "of " << x << oper << y << " is: " << 
•	result << endl; 
•	} 
•	return 0; 
•	}７ Note 
•	When you edit code while in debugging mode, there's a risk of code 
•	becoming stale. This happens when the debugger is still running your old 
•	code, and has not yet updated it with your changes. The debugger displays a 
•	dialog to inform you when this happens. Sometimes, you may need to press 
•	F5 to refresh the code being executed. In particular, if you make a change 
•	inside a function while the point of execution is inside that function, you need 
•	to step out of the function, then back into it again to get the updated code. If 
•	that doesn't work and you see an error message, you can stop debugging by 
•	clicking on the red square in the toolbar under the menus at the top of the 
•	IDE, then start debugging again by entering F5 or by choosing the green 
•	"play" arrow beside the stop button on the toolbar. 
•	Another reason edit and continue may fail is if you see a message that says 
•	"The Require source files to exactly match the original version setting under 
•	Debug->Options->General needs to be enabled..." To fix this, from the main 
•	menu select Tools > Options > Debugging > General and ensure that 
•	Require source files to exactly match the original version is checked. 
•	Understanding the Run and Debug shortcuts 
•	F5, or Debug > Start Debugging, starts a debugging session, if one isn't 
•	already active, and runs the program until a breakpoint is hit or the 
•	program needs user input. If no user input is needed and no breakpoint 
•	is available to hit, the program terminates and the console window closes 
•	itself when the program finishes running. If your program outputs to the 
•	console, use Ctrl+F5 or set a breakpoint before you press F5 to keep the 
•	window open. 
•	Ctrl+F5, or Debug > Start Without Debugging, runs the application 
•	without going into debug mode. This is slightly faster than debugging, 
•	and the console window stays open after the program finishes executing. 
•	F10, known as Step Over, lets you iterate through code, line-by-line, and 
•	visualize how the code is run and what variable values are at each step of 
•	execution.F11, known as Step Into, works similarly to Step Over, except it steps into 
•	any functions called on the line of execution. For example, if the line 
•	being executed calls a function, pressing F11 moves the pointer into the 
•	body of the function, so you can follow the function's code being run 
•	before coming back to the line you started at. Pressing F10 steps over the 
•	function call and just moves to the next line; the function call still 
•	happens, but the program doesn't pause to show you what it's doing. 
•	Close the app 
•	If it's still running, close the console window to stop the calculator app. 
•	Add Git source control 
•	Now that you've created an app, you might want to add it to a Git repository. We've got 
•	you covered. Visual Studio makes that process easy with Git tools you can use directly 
•	from the IDE. 
•	 Tip 
•	Git is the most widely used modern version control system, so whether you're a 
•	professional developer or you're learning how to code, Git can be very useful. If 
•	you're new to Git, the https://git-scm.com/ website is a good place to start. 
•	There, you can find cheat sheets, a popular online book, and Git Basics videos. 
•	To associate your code with Git, you start by creating a new Git repository where your 
•	code is located. Here's how: 
•	1. In the status bar at the bottom-right corner of Visual Studio, select Add to Source 
•	Control, and then select Git. 
•	2. In the Create a Git repository dialog box, sign in to GitHub.The repository name auto-populates based on your folder location. By default, 
•	your new repository is private, which means you're the only one who can access it. 
•	 Tip 
•	Whether your repository is public or private, it's best to have a remote backup 
•	of your code stored securely on GitHub. Even if you aren't working with a 
•	team, a remote repository makes your code available to you from any 
•	computer. 
•	3. Select Create and Push. 
•	After you create your repository, status details appear in the status bar. 
•	The first icon with the arrows shows how many outgoing/incoming commits are in 
•	your current branch. You can use this icon to pull any incoming commits or push 
•	any outgoing commits. You can also choose to view these commits first. To do so, 
•	select the icon, and then select View Outgoing/Incoming.Feedback 
•	Was this page helpful? 
•	Provide product feedback 
•	| Get help at Microsoft Q&A 
•	The second icon with the pencil shows the number of uncommitted changes to 
•	your code. You can select this icon to view those changes in the Git Changes 
•	window. 
•	To learn more about how to use Git with your app, see the Visual Studio version control 
•	documentation. 
•	Congratulations! You completed the code for the calculator app, built and debugged it, 
•	and added it to a repo, all in Visual Studio.

•	A C++/WinRT quick-start 
•	Create a new Windows Console Application (C++/WinRT) project. 
•	Edit pch.h and main.cpp to look like this. 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	// pch.h 
•	#pragma once 
•	#include <winrt/Windows.Foundation.Collections.h>C++/WinRT 
•	Let's take the short code example above piece by piece, and explain what's going on in 
•	each part. 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	With the default project settings, the included headers come from the Windows SDK, 
•	inside the folder 
•	%WindowsSdkDir%Include<WindowsTargetPlatformVersion>\cppwinrt\winrt . Visual Studio 
•	includes that path in its IncludePath macro. But there's no strict dependency on the 
•	#include <winrt/Windows.Web.Syndication.h> 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	// main.cpp 
•	#include "pch.h" 
•	using namespace winrt; 
•	using namespace Windows::Foundation; 
•	using namespace Windows::Web::Syndication; 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	winrt::init_apartment(); 
•	Uri rssFeedUri{ L"https://blogs.windows.com/feed" }; 
•	SyndicationClient syndicationClient; 
•	syndicationClient.SetRequestHeader(L"User-Agent", L"Mozilla/5.0 
•	(compatible; MSIE 10.0; Windows NT 6.2; WOW64; Trident/6.0)"); 
•	SyndicationFeed syndicationFeed = 
•	syndicationClient.RetrieveFeedAsync(rssFeedUri).get(); 
•	for (const SyndicationItem syndicationItem : syndicationFeed.Items()) 
•	{ 
•	winrt::hstring titleAsHstring = syndicationItem.Title().Text(); 
•	// A workaround to remove the trademark symbol from the title 
•	string, because it causes issues in this case. 
•	std::wstring titleAsStdWstring{ titleAsHstring.c_str() }; 
•	titleAsStdWstring.erase(remove(titleAsStdWstring.begin(), 
•	titleAsStdWstring.end(), L'™'), titleAsStdWstring.end()); 
•	titleAsHstring = titleAsStdWstring; 
•	std::wcout << titleAsHstring.c_str() << std::endl; 
•	} 
•	} 
•	#include <winrt/Windows.Foundation.Collections.h> 
•	#include <winrt/Windows.Web.Syndication.h>Windows SDK, because your project (via the cppwinrt.exe tool) generates those same 
•	headers into your project's $(GeneratedFilesDir) folder. They'll be loaded from that 
•	folder if they can't be found elsewhere, or if you change your project settings. 
•	The headers contain Windows APIs projected into C++/WinRT. In other words, for each 
•	Windows type, C++/WinRT defines a C++-friendly equivalent (called the projected type). 
•	A projected type has the same fully-qualified name as the Windows type, but it's placed 
•	in the C++ winrt namespace. Putting these includes in your precompiled header 
•	reduces incremental build times. 
•	） Important 
•	Whenever you want to use a type from a Windows namespaces, you must #include 
•	the corresponding C++/WinRT Windows namespace header file, as shown above. 
•	The corresponding header is the one with the same name as the type's namespace. 
•	For example, to use the C++/WinRT projection for the 
•	Windows::Foundation::Collections::PropertySet runtime class, include the 
•	winrt/Windows.Foundation.Collections.h header. 
•	It is common for a C++/WinRT projection header to automatically include related 
•	namespace header files. For example, winrt/Windows.Foundation.Collections.h 
•	includes winrt/Windows.Foundation.h . But you shouldn't rely on this behavior, since 
•	it's an implementation detail that changes over time. You must explicitly include 
•	any headers that you need. 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	using namespace winrt; 
•	using namespace Windows::Foundation; 
•	using namespace Windows::Web::Syndication; 
•	The using namespace directives are optional, but convenient. The pattern shown above 
•	for such directives (allowing unqualified name lookup for anything in the winrt 
•	namespace) is suitable for when you're beginning a new project and C++/WinRT is the 
•	only language projection you're using inside of that project. If, on the other hand, you're 
•	mixing C++/WinRT code with C++/CX and/or SDK application binary interface (ABI) 
•	code (you're either porting from, or interoperating with, one or both of those models), 
•	then see the topics Interop between C++/WinRT and C++/CX, Move to C++/WinRT 
•	from C++/CX, and Interop between C++/WinRT and the ABI. 
•	C++/WinRTwinrt::init_apartment(); 
•	The call to winrt::init_apartment initializes the thread in the Windows Runtime; by 
•	default, in a multithreaded apartment. The call also initializes COM. 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	Uri rssFeedUri{ L"https://blogs.windows.com/feed" }; 
•	SyndicationClient syndicationClient; 
•	Stack-allocate two objects: they represent the uri of the Windows blog, and a 
•	syndication client. We construct the uri with a simple wide string literal (see String 
•	handling in C++/WinRT for more ways you can work with strings). 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	SyndicationFeed syndicationFeed = 
•	syndicationClient.RetrieveFeedAsync(rssFeedUri).get(); 
•	SyndicationClient::RetrieveFeedAsync is an example of an asynchronous Windows 
•	Runtime function. The code example receives an asynchronous operation object from 
•	RetrieveFeedAsync, and it calls get on that object to block the calling thread and wait 
•	for the result (which is a syndication feed, in this case). For more about concurrency, and 
•	for non-blocking techniques, see Concurrency and asynchronous operations with 
•	C++/WinRT. 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	for (const SyndicationItem syndicationItem : syndicationFeed.Items()) { ... 
•	} 
•	SyndicationFeed.Items is a range, defined by the iterators returned from begin and end 
•	functions (or their constant, reverse, and constant-reverse variants). Because of this, you 
•	can enumerate Items with either a range-based for statement, or with the std::for_each 
•	template function. Whenever you iterate over a Windows Runtime collection like this, 
•	you'll need to #include <winrt/Windows.Foundation.Collections.h> . 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	winrt::hstring titleAsHstring = syndicationItem.Title().Text(); 
•	// Omitted: there's a little bit of extra work here to remove the trademark 
•	symbol from the title text.std::wcout << titleAsHstring.c_str() << std::endl; 
•	Gets the feed's title text, as a winrt::hstring object (more details in String handling in 
•	C++/WinRT). The hstring is then output, via the c_str function, which reflects the pattern 
•	used with C++ Standard Library strings. 
•	As you can see, C++/WinRT encourages modern, and class-like, C++ expressions such 
•	as syndicationItem.Title().Text() . This is a different, and cleaner, programming style 
•	from traditional COM programming. You don't need to directly initialize COM, nor work 
•	with COM pointers. 
•	Nor do you need to handle HRESULT return codes. C++/WinRT converts error HRESULTs 
•	to exceptions such as winrt::hresult-error for a natural and modern programming style. 
•	For more info about error-handling, and code examples, see Error handling with 
•	C++/WinRT. 
•	Modify a Windows Desktop application project 
•	to add C++/WinRT support 
•	Some desktop projects (for example, the WinUI 3 templates in Visual Studio) have 
•	C++/WinRT support built in. 
•	But this section shows you how you can add C++/WinRT support to any Windows 
•	Desktop application project that you might have. If you don't have an existing Windows 
•	Desktop application project, then you can follow along with these steps by first creating 
•	one. For example, open Visual Studio and create a Visual C++ > Windows Desktop > 
•	Windows Desktop Application project. 
•	You can optionally install the C++/WinRT Visual Studio Extension (VSIX) and the 
•	NuGet package. For details, see Visual Studio support for C++/WinRT. 
•	Set project properties 
•	Go to project property General > Windows SDK Version, and select All Configurations 
•	and All Platforms. Ensure that Windows SDK Version is set to 10.0.17134.0 (Windows 
•	10, version 1803) or greater. 
•	Confirm that you're not affected by Why won't my new project compile?. 
•	Because C++/WinRT uses features from the C++17 standard, set project property 
•	C/C++ > Language > C++ Language Standard to ISO C++17 Standard (/std:c++17).The precompiled header 
•	The default project template creates a precompiled header for you, named either 
•	framework.h , or stdafx.h . Rename that to pch.h . If you have a stdafx.cpp file, then 
•	rename that to pch.cpp . Set project property C/C++ > Precompiled Headers > 
•	Precompiled Header to Create (/Yc), and Precompiled Header File to pch.h. 
•	Find and replace all #include "framework.h" (or #include "stdafx.h" ) with #include 
•	"pch.h" . 
•	In pch.h , include winrt/base.h . 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	// pch.h 
•	... 
•	#include <winrt/base.h> 
•	Linking 
•	The C++/WinRT language projection depends on certain Windows Runtime free (non
•	member) functions, and entry points, that require linking to the WindowsApp.lib 
•	umbrella library. This section describes three ways of satisfying the linker. 
•	The first option is to add to your Visual Studio project all of the C++/WinRT MSBuild 
•	properties and targets. To do this, install the Microsoft.Windows.CppWinRT NuGet 
•	package into your project. Open the project in Visual Studio, click Project > Manage 
•	NuGet Packages... > Browse, type or paste Microsoft.Windows.CppWinRT in the search 
•	box, select the item in search results, and then click Install to install the package for that 
•	project. 
•	You can also use project link settings to explicitly link WindowsApp.lib . Or, you can do it 
•	in source code (in pch.h , for example) like this. 
•	C++/WinRT 
•	#pragma comment(lib, "windowsapp") 
•	You can now compile and link, and add C++/WinRT code to your project (for example, 
•	code similar to that shown in the A C++/WinRT quick-start section, above). 
•	The three main scenarios for C++/WinRTAs you use and become familiar with C++/WinRT, and work through the rest of the 
•	documentation here, you'll likely notice that there are three main scenarios, as described 
•	in the following sections. 
•	Consuming Windows APIs and types 
•	In other words, using, or calling APIs. For example, making API calls to communicate 
•	using Bluetooth; to stream and present video; to integrate with the Windows shell; and 
•	so on. C++/WinRT fully and uncompromisingly supports this category of scenario. For 
•	more info, see Consume APIs with C++/WinRT. 
•	Authoring Windows APIs and types 
•	In other words, producing APIs and types. For example, producing the kinds of APIs 
•	described in the section above; or the graphics APIs; the storage and file system APIs; 
•	the networking APIs, and so on. For more info, see Author APIs with C++/WinRT. 
•	Authoring APIs with C++/WinRT is a little more involved than consuming them, because 
•	you must use IDL to define the shape of the API before you can implement it. There's a 
•	walkthrough of doing that in XAML controls; bind to a C++/WinRT property. 
•	XAML applications 
•	This scenario is about building applications and controls on the XAML UI framework. 
•	Working in a XAML application amounts to a combination of consuming and authoring. 
•	But since XAML is the dominant UI framework on Windows today, and its influence over 
•	the Windows Runtime is proportionate to that, it deserves its own category of scenario. 
•	Be aware that XAML works best with programming languages that offer reflection. In 
•	C++/WinRT, you sometimes have to do a little extra work in order to interoperate with 
•	the XAML framework. All of those cases are covered in the documentation. Good places 
•	to start are XAML controls; bind to a C++/WinRT property and XAML custom 
•	(templated) controls with C++/WinRT.

•	Article • 02/14/2023 
•	An MFC application is an executable application for Windows that is based on the 
•	Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library. MFC executables generally fall into five types: 
•	standard Windows applications, dialog boxes, forms-based applications, Explorer-style 
•	applications, and Web browser-style applications. For more information, see: 
•	Using the Classes to Write Windows Applications 
•	Creating and Displaying Dialog Boxes

•	Creating a Web Browser-Style MFC Application 
•	The MFC Application Wizard generates the appropriate classes and files for any of these 
•	types of applications, depending on the options you select in the wizard. 
•	The easiest way to create an MFC application is to use the MFC Application Wizard (MFC 
•	App project in Visual Studio 2019). To create an MFC console application (a command
•	line program that uses MFC libraries but runs in the console window), use the Windows 
•	Desktop Wizard and choose the Console Application and MFC Headers options. 
•	To create an MFC forms or dialog-based 
•	application 
•	1. From the main menu, choose File > New > Project. 
•	2. Enter "MFC" into the search box and then choose MFC App from the result list. 
•	3. Modify the defaults as needed, then press Create to open the MFC Application 
•	Wizard. 
•	4. Modify the configuration values as needed, then press Finish. 
•	For more information, see Creating a forms-based MFC application.To create an MFC console application

•	Dynamic Link Library (C++) 
•	Article • 12/10/2021 
•	This step-by-step walkthrough shows how to use the Visual Studio IDE to create your 
•	own dynamic link library (DLL) written in Microsoft C++ (MSVC). Then it shows how to 
•	use the DLL from another C++ app. DLLs (also known as shared libraries in UNIX-based 
•	operating systems) are one of the most useful kinds of Windows components. You can 
•	use them as a way to share code and resources, and to shrink the size of your apps. 
•	DLLs can even make it easier to service and extend your apps. 
•	In this walkthrough, you'll create a DLL that implements some math functions. Then 
•	you'll create a console app that uses the functions from the DLL. You'll also get an 
•	introduction to some of the programming techniques and conventions used in Windows 
•	DLLs. 
•	This walkthrough covers these tasks: 
•	Create a DLL project in Visual Studio. 
•	Add exported functions and variables to the DLL. 
•	Create a console app project in Visual Studio. 
•	Use the functions and variables imported from the DLL in the console app. 
•	Run the completed app. 
•	Like a statically linked library, a DLL exports variables, functions, and resources by name. 
•	A client app imports the names to use those variables, functions, and resources. Unlike a 
•	statically linked library, Windows connects the imports in your app to the exports in a 
•	DLL at load time or at run time, instead of connecting them at link time. Windows 
•	requires extra information that isn't part of the standard C++ compilation model to 
•	make these connections. The MSVC compiler implements some Microsoft-specific 
•	extensions to C++ to provide this extra information. We explain these extensions as we 
•	go. 
•	This walkthrough creates two Visual Studio solutions; one that builds the DLL, and one 
•	that builds the client app. The DLL uses the C calling convention. It can be called from 
•	apps written in other programming languages, as long as the platform, calling 
•	conventions, and linking conventions match. The client app uses implicit linking, whereWindows links the app to the DLL at load-time. This linking lets the app call the DLL
•	supplied functions just like the functions in a statically linked library. 
•	This walkthrough doesn't cover some common situations. The code doesn't show the 
•	use of C++ DLLs by other programming languages. It doesn't show how to create a 
•	resource-only DLL, or how to use explicit linking to load DLLs at run-time rather than at 
•	load-time. Rest assured, you can use MSVC and Visual Studio to do all these things. 
•	Even though the code of the DLL is written in C++, we've used C-style interfaces for the 
•	exported functions. There are two main reasons for this: First, many other languages 
•	support imports of C-style functions. The client app doesn't have to be written in C++. 
•	Second, it avoids some common pitfalls related to exported classes and member 
•	functions. It's easy to make hard-to-diagnose errors when exporting classes, since 
•	everything referred to within a class declaration has to have an instantiation that's also 
•	exported. This restriction applies to DLLs, but not static libraries. If your classes are plain
•	old-data style, you shouldn't run into this issue.

•	Prerequisites 
•	A computer that runs Microsoft Windows 7 or later versions. We recommend the 
•	latest version of Windows for the best development experience. 
•	A copy of Visual Studio. For information on how to download and install Visual 
•	Studio, see Install Visual Studio. When you run the installer, make sure that the 
•	Desktop development with C++ workload is checked. Don't worry if you didn't 
•	install this workload when you installed Visual Studio. You can run the installer 
•	again and install it now. 
•	An understanding of the basics of using the Visual Studio IDE. If you've used 
•	Windows desktop apps before, you can probably keep up. For an introduction, seeVisual Studio IDE feature tour. 
•	An understanding of enough of the fundamentals of the C++ language to follow 
•	along. Don't worry, we don't do anything too complicated. 
•	Create the DLL project 
•	In this set of tasks, you create a project for your DLL, add code, and build it. To begin, 
•	start the Visual Studio IDE, and sign in if you need to. The instructions vary slightly 
•	depending on which version of Visual Studio you're using. Make sure you have the 
•	correct version selected in the control in the upper left of this page. 
•	To create a DLL project in Visual Studio 2019 
•	1. On the menu bar, choose File > New > Project to open the Create a New Project 
•	dialog box. 
•	2. At the top of the dialog, set Language to C++, set Platform to Windows, and set 
•	Project type to Library. 
•	3. From the filtered list of project types, select Dynamic-link Library (DLL), and then 
•	choose Next. 
•	4. In the Configure your new project page, enter MathLibrary in the Project name 
•	box to specify a name for the project. Leave the default Location and Solution 
•	name values. Set Solution to Create new solution. Uncheck Place solution and 
•	project in the same directory if it's checked. 
•	5. Choose the Create button to create the project.When the solution is created, you can see the generated project and source files in the 
•	Solution Explorer window in Visual Studio. 
•	Right now, this DLL doesn't do very much. Next, you'll create a header file to declare the 
•	functions your DLL exports, and then add the function definitions to the DLL to make it 
•	more useful. 
•	To add a header file to the DLL 
•	1. To create a header file for your functions, on the menu bar, choose Project > Add 
•	New Item. 
•	2. In the Add New Item dialog box, in the left pane, select Visual C++. In the center 
•	pane, select Header File (.h). Specify MathLibrary.h as the name for the header file.3. Choose the Add button to generate a blank header file, which is displayed in a new 
•	editor window. 
•	4. Replace the contents of the header file with this code: 
•	C++ 
•	// MathLibrary.h - Contains declarations of math functions 
•	#pragma once 
•	#ifdef MATHLIBRARY_EXPORTS 
•	#define MATHLIBRARY_API __declspec(dllexport) 
•	#else 
•	#define MATHLIBRARY_API __declspec(dllimport) 
•	#endif 
•	// The Fibonacci recurrence relation describes a sequence F 
•	// where F(n) is { n = 0, a 
•	// { n = 1, bThis header file declares some functions to produce a generalized Fibonacci sequence, 
•	given two initial values. A call to fibonacci_init(1, 1) generates the familiar Fibonacci 
•	number sequence. 
•	Notice the preprocessor statements at the top of the file. The new project template for a 
•	DLL project adds <PROJECTNAME>_EXPORTS to the defined preprocessor macros. In this 
•	example, Visual Studio defines MATHLIBRARY_EXPORTS when your MathLibrary DLL project 
•	is built. 
•	When the MATHLIBRARY_EXPORTS macro is defined, the MATHLIBRARY_API macro sets the 
•	__declspec(dllexport) modifier on the function declarations. This modifier tells the 
•	compiler and linker to export a function or variable from the DLL for use by other 
•	applications. When MATHLIBRARY_EXPORTS is undefined, for example, when the header file 
•	is included by a client application, MATHLIBRARY_API applies the __declspec(dllimport) 
•	modifier to the declarations. This modifier optimizes the import of the function or 
•	variable in an application. For more information, see dllexport, dllimport. 
•	1. In Solution Explorer, right-click on the Source Files node and choose Add > New 
•	Item. Create a new .cpp file called MathLibrary.cpp, in the same way that you 
•	added a new header file in the previous step. 
•	// { n > 1, F(n-2) + F(n-1) 
•	// for some initial integral values a and b. 
•	// If the sequence is initialized F(0) = 1, F(1) = 1, 
•	// then this relation produces the well-known Fibonacci 
•	// sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ... 
•	// Initialize a Fibonacci relation sequence 
•	// such that F(0) = a, F(1) = b. 
•	// This function must be called before any other function. 
•	extern "C" MATHLIBRARY_API void fibonacci_init( 
•	const unsigned long long a, const unsigned long long b); 
•	// Produce the next value in the sequence. 
•	// Returns true on success and updates current value and index; 
•	// false on overflow, leaves current value and index unchanged. 
•	extern "C" MATHLIBRARY_API bool fibonacci_next(); 
•	// Get the current value in the sequence. 
•	extern "C" MATHLIBRARY_API unsigned long long fibonacci_current(); 
•	// Get the position of the current value in the sequence. 
•	extern "C" MATHLIBRARY_API unsigned fibonacci_index(); 
•	To add an implementation to the DLL2. In the editor window, select the tab for MathLibrary.cpp if it's already open. If not, 
•	in Solution Explorer, double-click MathLibrary.cpp in the Source Files folder of the 
•	MathLibrary project to open it. 
•	3. In the editor, replace the contents of the MathLibrary.cpp file with the following 
•	code: 
•	C++ 
•	// MathLibrary.cpp : Defines the exported functions for the DLL. 
•	#include "pch.h" // use stdafx.h in Visual Studio 2017 and earlier 
•	#include <utility> 
•	#include <limits.h> 
•	#include "MathLibrary.h" 
•	// DLL internal state variables: 
•	static unsigned long long previous_; // Previous value, if any 
•	static unsigned long long current_; // Current sequence value 
•	static unsigned index_; // Current seq. position 
•	// Initialize a Fibonacci relation sequence 
•	// such that F(0) = a, F(1) = b. 
•	// This function must be called before any other function. 
•	void fibonacci_init( 
•	const unsigned long long a, 
•	const unsigned long long b) 
•	{ 
•	index_ = 0; 
•	current_ = a; 
•	previous_ = b; // see special case when initialized 
•	} 
•	// Produce the next value in the sequence. 
•	// Returns true on success, false on overflow. 
•	bool fibonacci_next() 
•	{ 
•	// check to see if we'd overflow result or position 
•	if ((ULLONG_MAX - previous_ < current_) || 
•	(UINT_MAX == index_)) 
•	{ 
•	return false; 
•	} 
•	// Special case when index == 0, just return b value 
•	if (index_ > 0) 
•	{ 
•	// otherwise, calculate next sequence value 
•	previous_ += current_; 
•	} 
•	std::swap(current_, previous_); 
•	++index_; 
•	return true; 
•	}To verify that everything works so far, compile the dynamic link library. To compile, 
•	choose Build > Build Solution on the menu bar. The DLL and related compiler output 
•	are placed in a folder called Debug directly below the solution folder. If you create a 
•	Release build, the output is placed in a folder called Release. The output should look 
•	something like this: 
•	Output 
•	Congratulations, you've created a DLL using Visual Studio! Next, you'll create a client 
•	app that uses the functions exported by the DLL. 
•	When you create a DLL, think about how client apps may use it. To call the functions or 
•	access the data exported by a DLL, client source code must have the declarations 
•	available at compile time. At link time, the linker requires information to resolve the 
•	function calls or data accesses. A DLL supplies this information in an import library, a file 
•	that contains information about how to find the functions and data, instead of the actual 
•	code. And at run time, the DLL must be available to the client, in a location that the 
•	operating system can find. 
•	// Get the current value in the sequence. 
•	unsigned long long fibonacci_current() 
•	{ 
•	return current_; 
•	} 
•	// Get the current index position in the sequence. 
•	unsigned fibonacci_index() 
•	{

•	Create a client app that uses the DLLWhether it's your own or from a third-party, your client app project needs several pieces 
•	of information to use a DLL. It needs to find the headers that declare the DLL exports, 
•	the import libraries for the linker, and the DLL itself. One solution is to copy all of these 
•	files into your client project. For third-party DLLs that are unlikely to change while your 
•	client is in development, this method may be the best way to use them. However, when 
•	you also build the DLL, it's better to avoid duplication. If you make a local copy of DLL 
•	files that are under development, you may accidentally change a header file in one copy 
•	but not the other, or use an out-of-date library. 
•	To avoid out-of-sync code, we recommend you set the include path in your client 
•	project to include the DLL header files directly from your DLL project. Also, set the 
•	library path in your client project to include the DLL import libraries from the DLL 
•	project. And finally, copy the built DLL from the DLL project into your client build output 
•	directory. This step allows your client app to use the same DLL code you build. 
•	To create a client app in Visual Studio 
•	1. On the menu bar, choose File > New > Project to open the Create a new project 
•	dialog box. 
•	2. At the top of the dialog, set Language to C++, set Platform to Windows, and set 
•	Project type to Console. 
•	3. From the filtered list of project types, choose Console App then choose Next. 
•	4. In the Configure your new project page, enter MathClient in the Project name box 
•	to specify a name for the project. Leave the default Location and Solution name 
•	values. Set Solution to Create new solution. Uncheck Place solution and project in 
•	the same directory if it's checked. 
•	5. Choose the Create button to create the client project.A minimal console application project is created for you. The name for the main source 
•	file is the same as the project name that you entered earlier. In this example, it's named 
•	MathClient.cpp. You can build it, but it doesn't use your DLL yet. 
•	Next, to call the MathLibrary functions in your source code, your project must include 
•	the MathLibrary.h file. You could copy this header file into your client app project, then 
•	add it to the project as an existing item. This method can be a good choice for third
•	party libraries. However, if you're working on the code for your DLL and your client at 
•	the same time, the header files could get out of sync. To avoid this issue, set the 
•	Additional Include Directories path in your project to include the path to the original 
•	header. 
•	To add the DLL header to your include path 
•	1. Right-click on the MathClient node in Solution Explorer to open the Property 
•	Pages dialog. 
•	2. In the Configuration drop-down box, select All Configurations if it's not already 
•	selected. 
•	3. In the left pane, select Configuration Properties > C/C++ > General. 
•	4. In the property pane, select the drop-down control next to the Additional Include 
•	Directories edit box, and then choose Edit.5. Double-click in the top pane of the Additional Include Directories dialog box to 
•	enable an edit control. Or, choose the folder icon to create a new entry. 
•	6. In the edit control, specify the path to the location of the MathLibrary.h header 
•	file. You can choose the ellipsis (...) control to browse to the correct folder. 
•	You can also enter a relative path from your client source files to the folder that 
•	contains the DLL header files. If you followed the directions to put your client 
•	project in a separate solution from the DLL, the relative path should look like this: 
•	..\..\MathLibrary\MathLibrary 
•	If your DLL and client projects are in the same solution, the relative path might 
•	look like this: 
•	..\MathLibrary 
•	When the DLL and client projects are in other folders, adjust the relative path to 
•	match. Or, use the ellipsis control to browse for the folder. 
•	7. After you've entered the path to the header file in the Additional Include 
•	Directories dialog box, choose the OK button. In the Property Pages dialog box, 
•	choose the OK button to save your changes. 
•	You can now include the MathLibrary.h file and use the functions it declares in your 
•	client application. Replace the contents of MathClient.cpp by using this code: 
•	C++This code can be compiled, but not linked. If you build the client app now, the error list 
•	shows several LNK2019 errors. That's because your project is missing some information: 
•	You haven't specified that your project has a dependency on the MathLibrary.lib library 
•	yet. And, you haven't told the linker how to find the MathLibrary.lib file. 
•	To fix this issue, you could copy the library file directly into your client app project. The 
•	linker would find and use it automatically. However, if both the library and the client app 
•	are under development, that might lead to changes in one copy that aren't shown in the 
•	other. To avoid this issue, you can set the Additional Dependencies property to tell the 
•	build system that your project depends on MathLibrary.lib. And, you can set an 
•	Additional Library Directories path in your project to include the path to the original 
•	library when you link. 
•	1. Right-click on the MathClient node in Solution Explorer and choose Properties to 
•	open the Property Pages dialog. 
•	2. In the Configuration drop-down box, select All Configurations if it's not already 
•	selected. It ensures that any property changes apply to both Debug and Release 
•	builds. 
•	3. In the left pane, select Configuration Properties > Linker > Input. In the property 
•	pane, select the drop-down control next to the Additional Dependencies edit box, 
•	and then choose Edit.

•	5. Choose OK to go back to the Property Pages dialog box. 
•	6. In the left pane, select Configuration Properties > Linker > General. In the

•	Directories edit box, and then choose Edit.7. Double-click in the top pane of the Additional Library Directories dialog box to 
•	enable an edit control. In the edit control, specify the path to the location of the 
•	MathLibrary.lib file. By default, it's in a folder called Debug directly under the DLL 
•	solution folder. If you create a release build, the file is placed in a folder called 
•	Release. You can use the $(IntDir) macro so that the linker can find your DLL, no 
•	matter which kind of build you create. If you followed the directions to put your 
•	client project in a separate solution from the DLL project, the relative path should 
•	look like this: 
•	..\..\MathLibrary\$(IntDir) 
•	If your DLL and client projects are in other locations, adjust the relative path to 
•	match.8. Once you've entered the path to the library file in the Additional Library 
•	Directories dialog box, choose the OK button to go back to the Property Pages 
•	dialog box. Choose OK to save the property changes. 
•	Your client app can now compile and link successfully, but it still doesn't have everything 
•	it needs to run. When the operating system loads your app, it looks for the MathLibrary 
•	DLL. If it can't find the DLL in certain system directories, the environment path, or the 
•	local app directory, the load fails. Depending on the operating system, you'll see an 
•	error message like this: 
•	One way to avoid this issue is to copy the DLL to the directory that contains your client 
•	executable as part of the build process. You can add a Post-Build Event to your project, 
•	to add a command that copies the DLL to your build output directory. The command 
•	specified here copies the DLL only if it's missing or has changed. It uses macros to copy 
•	to and from the Debug or Release locations, based on your build configuration. 
•	To copy the DLL in a post-build event 
•	1. Right-click on the MathClient node in Solution Explorer and choose Properties to 
•	open the Property Pages dialog.2. In the Configuration drop-down box, select All Configurations if it isn't already 
•	selected. 
•	3. In the left pane, select Configuration Properties > Build Events > Post-Build 
•	Event. 
•	4. In the property pane, select the edit control in the Command Line field. If you 
•	followed the directions to put your client project in a separate solution from the 
•	DLL project, then enter this command: 
•	xcopy /y /d "..\..\MathLibrary\$(IntDir)MathLibrary.dll" "$(OutDir)" 
•	If your DLL and client projects are in other directories, change the relative path to 
•	the DLL to match. 
•	5. Choose the OK button to save your changes to the project properties. 
•	Now your client app has everything it needs to build and run. Build the application by 
•	choosing Build > Build Solution on the menu bar. The Output window in Visual Studio 
•	should have something like the following example depending on your version of Visual 
•	Studio: 
•	Output

•	Congratulations, you've created an application that calls functions in your DLL. Now run 
•	your application to see what it does. On the menu bar, choose Debug > Start Without 
•	Debugging. Visual Studio opens a command window for the program to run in. The last 
•	part of the output should look like: 
•	Press any key to dismiss the command window. 
•	Now that you've created a DLL and a client application, you can experiment. Try setting 
•	breakpoints in the code of the client app, and run the app in the debugger. See what 
•	happens when you step into a library call. Add other functions to the library, or write 
•	another client app that uses your DLL. 
•	When you deploy your app, you must also deploy the DLLs it uses. The simplest way to 
•	make the DLLs that you build, or that you include from third parties, available is to put 
•	them in the same directory as your app. It's known as app-local deployment. For more

•	Calling DLL Functions from Visual Basic ApplicationsWalkthrough: Create and use a static 
•	library 
•	Article • 10/29/2021 
•	This step-by-step walkthrough shows how to create a static library (.lib file) for use with 
•	C++ apps. Using a static library is a great way to reuse code. Rather than 
•	reimplementing the same routines in every app that requires the functionality, you write 
•	them one time in a static library and then reference it from the apps. Code linked from a 
•	static library becomes part of your app—you don't have to install another file to use the 
•	code. 
•	This walkthrough covers these tasks: 
•	Create a static library project 
•	Add a class to the static library 
•	Create a C++ console app that references the static library 
•	Use the functionality from the static library in the app 
•	Run the app 
•	Prerequisites 
•	An understanding of the fundamentals of the C++ language. 
•	Create a static library project 
•	The instructions for how to create the project vary depending on your version of Visual 
•	Studio. To see the documentation for your preferred version of Visual Studio, use the 
•	Version selector control. It's found at the top of the table of contents on this page. 
•	To create a static library project in Visual Studio 
•	1. On the menu bar, choose File > New > Project to open the Create a New Project 
•	dialog. 
•	2. At the top of the dialog, set Language to C++, set Platform to Windows, and set 
•	Project type to Library.3. From the filtered list of project types, select Windows Desktop Wizard, then 
•	choose Next. 
•	4. In the Configure your new project page, enter MathLibrary in the Project name 
•	box to specify a name for the project. Enter StaticMath in the Solution name box. 
•	Choose the Create button to open the Windows Desktop Project dialog. 
•	5. In the Windows Desktop Project dialog, under Application type, select Static 
•	Library (.lib). 
•	6. Under Additional options, uncheck the Precompiled header check box if it's

•	Desktop Applications (Visual C++)Walkthrough: Compile a C++/CLI 
•	program that targets the CLR in Visual 
•	Studio 
•	Article • 10/29/2021 
•	By using C++/CLI you can create C++ programs that use .NET classes as well as native 
•	C++ types. C++/CLI is intended for use in console applications and in DLLs that wrap 
•	native C++ code and make it accessible from .NET programs. To create a Windows user 
•	interface based on .NET, use C# or Visual Basic. 
•	For this procedure, you can type your own C++ program or use one of the sample 
•	programs. The sample program that we use in this procedure creates a text file named 
•	textfile.txt, and saves it to the project directory. 
•	Prerequisites 
•	An understanding of the fundamentals of the C++ language. 
•	In Visual Studio 2017 and later, C++/CLI support is an optional component. To 
•	install it, open the Visual Studio Installer from the Windows Start menu. Make sure 
•	that the Desktop development with C++ tile is checked, and in the Optional 
•	components section, also check C++/CLI Support. 
•	Create a new project 
•	The following steps vary depending on which version of Visual Studio you are using. To 
•	see the documentation for your preferred version of Visual Studio, use the Version 
•	selector control. It's found at the top of the table of contents on this page. 
•	To create a C++/CLI project in Visual Studio 
•	1. In Solution Explorer, right-click on the top to open the Create a New Project 
•	dialog box. 
•	2. At the top of the dialog, type CLR in the search box and then choose CLR Empty 
•	Project from the results list. 
•	3. Choose the Create button to create the project.Add a source file 
•	1. If Solution Explorer isn't visible, click Solution Explorer on the View menu. 
•	2. Add a new source file to the project: 
•	Right-click the Source Files folder in Solution Explorer, point to Add, and 
•	click New Item. 
•	Click C++ File (.cpp) and type a file name and then click Add. 
•	The .cpp file appears in the Source Files folder in Solution Explorer and a tabbed 
•	window appears where you type the code you want in that file. 
•	3. Click in the newly created tab in Visual Studio and type a valid Visual C++ 
•	program, or copy and paste one of the sample programs. 
•	For example, you can use the How to: Write a Text File (C++/CLI) sample program 
•	(in the File Handling and I/O node of the Programming Guide). 
•	If you use the sample program, notice that you use the gcnew keyword instead of 
•	new when creating a .NET object, and that gcnew returns a handle ( ^ ) rather than a 
•	pointer ( * ): 
•	StreamWriter^ sw = gcnew StreamWriter(fileName); 
•	For more information on C++/CLI syntax, see Component Extensions for Runtime 
•	Platforms. 
•	4. On the Build menu, click Build Solution. 
•	The Output window displays information about the compilation progress, such as 
•	the location of the build log and a message that indicates the build status. 
•	If you make changes and run the program without doing a build, a dialog box 
•	might indicate that the project is out of date. Select the checkbox on this dialog 
•	before you click OK if you want Visual Studio to always use the current versions of 
•	files instead of prompting you each time it builds the application. 
•	5. On the Debug menu, click Start without Debugging. 
•	6. If you used the sample program, when you run the program a command window is 
•	displayed that indicates the text file has been created. 
•	The textfile.txt text file is now located in your project directory. You can open this 
•	file by using Notepad.７ Note 
•	Choosing the empty CLR project template automatically set the /clr 
•	compiler option. To verify this, right-click the project in Solution Explorer and 
•	clicking Properties, and then check the Common Language Runtime support 
•	option in the General node of Configuration Properties.

•	Use code snippetsVisual Studio provides useful code snippets that you can use to quickly and easily 
•	generate commonly used code blocks. Code snippets are available for different 
•	programming languages including C#, Visual Basic, and C++. 
•	Let's add the C# void Main snippet to our file. 
•	1. Place your cursor just above the final closing brace } in the file, and type the 
•	characters svm . 
•	A pop-up dialog box appears with information about the svm code snippet. 
•	2. Select the Tab key twice to insert the code snippet. 
•	You'll see the static void Main() method signature get added to the file. The 
•	Main() method is the entry point for C# applications. 
•	Available code snippets vary for different programming languages. You can look at the 
•	available code snippets for your language by choosing Edit > IntelliSense > Insert 
•	Snippet or by selecting the Ctrl+K, Ctrl+X keys, and then choosing the folder for your 
•	programming language. For C#, the snippet list looks like this:The list includes snippets for creating a class, a constructor, a for loop, an if or switch 
•	statement, and more. 
•	The Text Editor toolbar, which is the row of buttons under the menu bar in Visual Studio, 
•	helps make you more productive as you code. For example, you can toggle IntelliSense 
•	completion mode, increase or decrease a line indent, or comment out code that you 
•	don't want to compile. 
•	Let's comment out some code. 
•	1. Paste the following code into the Main() method body. 
•	C# 
•	Comment out code 
•	// someWords is a string array. 
•	string[] someWords = { 
•	"the", 
•	"quick", 
•	"brown", 
•	"fox", 
•	"jumps" 
•	};2. We're not using the moreWords variable, but we might use it later so we don't want 
•	to delete it. Instead, we'll comment out those lines. Select the entire definition of 
•	moreWords down to the closing semicolon, and then choose the Comment out the 
•	selected lines button on the Text Editor toolbar. If you prefer to use the keyboard, 
•	select Ctrl+K, Ctrl+C. 
•	The C# comment characters // are added to the beginning of each selected line 
•	to comment out the code. 
•	When you want to uncomment lines, you can select them, and then choose the 
•	Uncomment the selected lines button on the Text Editor toolbar. If you prefer to 
•	use the keyboard, select Ctrl+K, Ctrl+U. 
•	We don't want to see the empty constructor that was generated for Class1 , so to 
•	unclutter our view of the code, let's collapse it. Choose the small gray box with the 
•	minus sign inside it in the margin of the first line of the constructor. Or, if you prefer to 
•	use the keyboard, place the cursor anywhere in the constructor code and select the 
•	Ctrl+M, Ctrl+M keys. 
•	string[] moreWords = { 
•	"over", 
•	"the", 
•	"lazy", 
•	"dog" 
•	}; 
•	// Alphabetically sort the words. 
•	IEnumerable<string> query = from word in someWords 
•	orderby word 
•	select word; 
•	Collapse code blocksThe code block collapses to just the first line, followed by an ellipsis ( ... ). To expand 
•	the code block again, select the same gray box that now has a plus sign in it, or select 
•	Ctrl+M, Ctrl+M again. This feature is called Outlining and is especially useful when 
•	you're collapsing long methods or entire classes. 
•	View symbol definitions 
•	The Visual Studio editor makes it easy to inspect the definition of a type, method, or 
•	variable. One way is to go to the definition, in whichever file has it, by choosing Go to 
•	Definition or by selecting the F12 key anywhere a symbol is referenced. An even quicker 
•	way that doesn't move your focus away from the code you're working on is to use Peek 
•	Definition. 
•	Let's peek at the definition of the string type. 
•	1. Right-click on any occurrence of string and choose Peek Definition from the 
•	content menu. Or, select the Alt+F12 keys. 
•	A pop-up window appears with the definition of the String class. You can scroll 
•	within the pop-up window, or even peek at the definition of another type from the 
•	peeked code. 
•	2. Close the peek definition window by choosing the small box with an "x" at the top 
•	right of the pop-up window. 
•	Use IntelliSense to complete words 
•	IntelliSense is an invaluable resource when you're coding. It can show you information 
•	about available members of a type, or parameter details for different overloads of amethod. You can also use IntelliSense to complete a word after you type enough 
•	characters to disambiguate it. 
•	Let's add a line of code to print out the ordered strings to the console window, which is 
•	the standard place for output from the program to go. 
•	1. Below the query variable, start typing the following code: 
•	C# 
•	You'll see an IntelliSense pop-up appear with information about the query symbol. 
•	2. To insert the rest of the word query by using IntelliSense word completion, select 
•	the Tab key. 
•	3. Finish off the code block to look like the following code. You can practice further 
•	with code snippets by entering cw and then selecting Tab twice to generate the 
•	Console.WriteLine statement. 
•	C# 
•	Nobody gets code right the first time, and one of the things you might have to change 
•	is the name of a variable or method. Let's try out Visual Studio's refactor functionality to 
•	rename the someWords variable to unsortedWords . 
•	foreach (string str in qu 
•	foreach (string str in query) 
•	{ 
•	Console.WriteLine(str); 
•	} 
•	Refactor a name1. Place your cursor over the definition of the someWords variable, and choose 
•	Rename from the right-click or context menu, or select the F2 key. 
•	A Rename dialog box appears at the top right of the editor. 
•	2. Enter the desired name unsortedWords. You'll see that the reference to 
•	unsortedWords in the query assignment statement is also automatically renamed. 
•	Before you select the Enter key, select the Include comments checkbox in the 
•	Rename pop-up box. 
•	3. Select the Enter key. 
•	Both occurrences of someWords in your code have been renamed, as well as the 
•	text someWords in your code comment.

•	Visual Studio debugger 
•	Article • 01/12/2024 
•	The Visual Studio debugger provides many powerful features to help you debug your 
•	apps. This topic provides a quick way to learn some of the basic features. 
•	1. Open Visual Studio and create a project. 
•	Press Esc to close the start window. Type Ctrl + Q to open the search box, type 
•	c++, choose Templates, then choose Create new Console App project. In the 
•	dialog box that appears, choose Create. 
•	If you don't see the Windows Console Application project template, go to Tools > 
•	Get Tools and Features..., which opens the Visual Studio Installer. The Visual Studio 
•	Installer launches. Choose the Desktop development with C++ workload, then 
•	choose Modify. 
•	Visual Studio creates the project. 
•	2. In MyDbgApp.cpp, replace the following code 
•	C++ 
•	with this code (do not remove #include "stdafx.h" ): 
•	C++ 
•	Create a new project 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	return 0; 
•	} 
•	#include <list> 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	using namespace std; 
•	void doWork() 
•	{ 
•	list <int> c1;A breakpoint is a marker that indicates where Visual Studio should suspend your running 
•	code so you can take a look at the values of variables, or the behavior of memory, or 
•	whether or not a branch of code is getting run. It is the most basic feature in debugging. 
•	1. To set the breakpoint, click in the gutter to the left of the doWork function call (or 
•	select the line of code and press F9). 
•	2. Now press F5 (or choose Debug > Start Debugging). 
•	The debugger pauses where you set the breakpoint. The statement where the 
•	debugger and app execution is paused is indicated by the yellow arrow. The line 
•	with the doWork function call has not yet executed. 
•	c1.push_back(10); 
•	c1.push_back(20); 
•	const list <int> c2 = c1; 
•	const int &i = c2.front(); 
•	const int &j = c2.front(); 
•	cout << "The first element is " << i << endl; 
•	cout << "The second element is " << j << endl; 
•	} 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	doWork(); 
•	} 
•	Set a breakpoint 
•	 TipIf you have a breakpoint in a loop or recursion, or if you have many 
•	breakpoints that you frequently step through, use a conditional breakpoint to 
•	make sure that your code is suspended ONLY when specific conditions are 
•	met. A conditional breakpoint saves time and can also make it easier to debug 
•	issues that are hard to reproduce. 
•	When trying to debug memory-related failures in C++, you can also use 
•	breakpoints to inspect address values (look for NULL) and reference counts. 
•	Navigate code 
•	There are different commands to instruct the debugger to continue. We show a useful 
•	code navigation command that is available starting in Visual Studio 2017. 
•	While paused at the breakpoint, hover over the statement c1.push_back(20) until the 
•	green Run to click button appears, and then press the Run to click button. 
•	The app continues execution, calling doWork , and pauses on the line of code where you 
•	clicked the button. 
•	Common keyboard commands used to step through code include F10 and F11. For more 
•	in-depth instructions, see First look at the debugger. 
•	Inspect variables in a datatip 
•	1. In the current line of code (marked by the yellow execution pointer), hover over 
•	the c1 object with your mouse to show a datatip.The datatip shows you the current value of the c1 variable and allows you to 
•	inspect its properties. When debugging, if you see a value you don't expect, you 
•	probably have a bug in the preceding or calling lines of code. 
•	2. Expand the datatip to look at the current property values of the c1 object. 
•	3. If you want to pin the datatip so that you can continue to see the value of c1 while 
•	you execute code, click the small pin icon. (You can move the pinned datatip to a 
•	convenient location.) 
•	Edit code and continue debugging 
•	If you identify a change that you want to test in your code while in the middle of a 
•	debugging session, you can do that, too. 
•	1. Click the second instance of c2.front() and change c2.front() to c2.back() . 
•	2. Press F10 (or Debug > Step Over) a few times to advance the debugger and 
•	execute the edited code. 
•	F10 advances the debugger one statement at a time, but steps over functions 
•	instead of stepping into them (the code that you skip still executes). 
•	For more information on using edit-and-continue and on feature limitations, see Edit 
•	and Continue.Feedback

•	Article • 12/16/2024 
•	You can write and run your C++ unit tests by using the Test Explorer window. It works 
•	just like it does for other languages. For more information about using Test Explorer, 
•	see Run unit tests with Test Explorer. 
•	７ Note 
•	Some features such as Live Unit Testing, Coded UI Tests and IntelliTest aren't 
•	supported for C++. 
•	Visual Studio includes these C++ test frameworks with no extra downloads required: 
•	Microsoft Unit Testing Framework for C++ 
•	Google Test 
•	Boost.Test 
•	CTest 
•	You can use the installed frameworks, or write your own test adapter for whatever 
•	framework you want to use within Visual Studio. A test adapter integrates unit tests with 
•	the Test Explorer window. Several non-Microsoft adapters are available on the Visual 
•	Studio Marketplace . For more information, see Install unit test frameworks. 
•	Visual Studio 2017 and later (Professional and Enterprise) 
•	C++ unit test projects support CodeLens. 
•	Visual Studio 2017 and later (all editions) 
•	Google Test Adapter is included as a default component of the Desktop 
•	development with C++ workload. It has a project template that you can add to 
•	a solution. Right-click on the solution node in Solution Explorer and choose 
•	Add > New Project on the shortcut menu to add the project template. It also 
•	has options you can configure by using Tools > Options. For more information, 
•	see How to: Use Google Test in Visual Studio. 
•	Boost.Test is included as a default component of the Desktop development 
•	with C++ workload. It's integrated with Test Explorer, but currently doesn'thave a project template. You must manually configure it. For more information, 
•	see How to: Use Boost.Test in Visual Studio. 
•	CTest support is included with the C++ CMake tools component, which is part 
•	of the Desktop development with C++ workload. For more information, see 
•	How to: Use CTest in Visual Studio. 
•	Earlier versions of Visual Studio 
•	You can download the Google Test adapter and Boost.Test Adapter extensions on 
•	the Visual Studio Marketplace. Find them at Test adapter for Boost.Test and Test 
•	adapter for Google Test . 
•	 Tip 
•	You can also use Copilot /tests slash command to generate unit tests from code. 
•	For example, you can type /tests using Boost framework to generate Boost.Test 
•	tests. For more information, see Use slash commands in Copilot Chat. 
•	Basic test workflow 
•	The following sections show the basic steps to get you started with C++ unit testing. 
•	The basic configuration is similar for both the Microsoft and Google Test frameworks. 
•	Boost.Test requires that you manually create a test project. 
•	Create a test project in Visual Studio 2022 
•	Define and run unit tests inside one or more test projects. A test project creates a 
•	separate app that calls the code in your executable and reports on its behavior. Create 
•	test projects in the same solution as the code you want to test. 
•	To add a new test project to an existing solution: 
•	1. Right-click on the Solution node in Solution Explorer. 
•	2. In the context menu, choose Add > New Project. 
•	3. Set Language to C++ and type test in the search box. The following screenshot 
•	shows the test projects that are available when the Desktop Development with 
•	C++ and the UWP Development workload are installed:Create references to other projects in the solution 
•	To enable access to the functions in the project under test, add a reference to the 
•	project in your test project. In Solution Explorer, expand your test project. Right-click 
•	References and then select Add > Reference. In the Add Reference dialog box, choose 
•	the projects you want to test.Link to object or library files 
•	If the test code doesn't export the functions that you want to test, add the output .obj 
•	or .lib files to the dependencies of the test project. For more information, see To link 
•	the tests to the object or library files. Don't include object files that have a main function 
•	or another standard entry point such as wmain , WinMain , or DllMain . When you add new 
•	source files to your project, update the test project dependencies to include the 
•	corresponding object files. 
•	Add #include directives for header files 
•	In your unit test .cpp file, add an #include directive for any header files that declare the 
•	types and functions you want to test. Type #include " , and then IntelliSense activates to 
•	help you choose. Repeat for any more headers. Tip 
•	To avoid having to type the full path in each include statement in the source file, 
•	add the required folders in Project > Properties > C/C++ > General > Additional 
•	Include Directories. 
•	Write test methods 
•	７ Note 
•	This section shows syntax for the Microsoft Unit Testing Framework for C/C++. For 
•	more information, see Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.CppUnitTestFramework 
•	API reference. 
•	For Google Test documentation, see Google Test primer . For Boost.Test, see 
•	Boost Test library: The unit test framework . 
•	The .cpp file in your test project has a stub class and method defined for you. They 
•	show an example of how to write test code. The signatures use the TEST_CLASS and 
•	TEST_METHOD macros, which make the methods discoverable from the Test Explorer 
•	window.TEST_CLASS and TEST_METHOD are part of the Microsoft Native Test Framework. Test 
•	Explorer discovers test methods in other supported frameworks in a similar way. 
•	A TEST_METHOD returns void. To produce a test result, use the static methods in the 
•	Assert class to test actual results against expected results. In the following example, 
•	assume MyClass has a constructor that takes a std::string . This example shows how 
•	you can test that the constructor initializes the class the way you expect: 
•	C++ 
•	In the previous example, the result of the Assert::AreEqual call determines whether the 
•	test passes or fails. The Assert class contains many other methods to compare expected 
•	results with actual results. 
•	You can add traits to test methods to specify test owners, priority, and other 
•	information. You can then use these values to sort and group tests in Test Explorer. For 
•	more information, see Run unit tests with Test Explorer. 
•	1. On the Test menu, choose Test Explorer. The following illustration shows a test 
•	project before you run tests. 
•	TEST_METHOD(TestClassInit) 
•	{ 
•	std::string name = "Bill"; 
•	MyClass mc(name); 
•	Assert::AreEqual(name, mc.GetName()); 
•	} 
•	Run the tests７ Note 
•	CTest integration with Test Explorer is not yet available. Run CTest tests from 
•	the CMake main menu. 
•	2. If any of your tests are missing from the window, build the test project by right
•	clicking its node in Solution Explorer and choosing Build or Rebuild. 
•	3. In Test Explorer, choose Run All, or select the specific tests you want to run. Right
•	click on a test for other options, including running it in debug mode with 
•	breakpoints enabled. After all the tests run, the window shows the tests that 
•	passed and the ones that failed. 
•	For failed tests, the message displays details that help to diagnose the cause. Right-click 
•	on the failing test for a pop-up menu. Choose Debug to step through the function 
•	where the failure occurred.For more information on using Test Explorer, see Run unit tests with Test Explorer. 
•	For more information on unit testing, see Unit test basics. 
•	Use CodeLens 
•	Visual Studio 2017 and later (Professional and Enterprise editions) 
•	CodeLens lets you quickly see the status of a unit test without leaving the code editor. 
•	Initialize CodeLens for a C++ unit test project in any of the following ways: 
•	Edit and build your test project or solution. 
•	Rebuild your project or solution. 
•	Run tests from the Test Explorer window. 
•	After you initialize CodeLens, you can see the test status icons above each unit test.

•	 NoWalkthrough: Compiling a Native C++ 
•	Program on the Command Line 
•	Article • 02/08/2022 
•	Visual Studio includes a command-line C and C++ compiler. You can use it to create 
•	everything from basic console apps to Universal Windows Platform apps, Desktop apps, 
•	device drivers, and .NET components. 
•	In this walkthrough, you create a basic, "Hello, World"-style C++ program by using a 
•	text editor, and then compile it on the command line. If you'd like to try the Visual 
•	Studio IDE instead of using the command line, see Walkthrough: Working with Projects 
•	and Solutions (C++) or Using the Visual Studio IDE for C++ Desktop Development. 
•	In this walkthrough, you can use your own C++ program instead of typing the one 
•	that's shown. Or, you can use a C++ code sample from another help article. 
•	Prerequisites 
•	To complete this walkthrough, you must have installed either Visual Studio and the 
•	optional Desktop development with C++ workload, or the command-line Build Tools 
•	for Visual Studio. 
•	Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE). It supports a full-featured 
•	editor, resource managers, debuggers, and compilers for many languages and 
•	platforms. Versions available include the free Visual Studio Community edition, and all 
•	can support C and C++ development. For information on how to download and install 
•	Visual Studio, see Install C++ support in Visual Studio. 
•	The Build Tools for Visual Studio installs only the command-line compilers, tools, and 
•	libraries you need to build C and C++ programs. It's perfect for build labs or classroom 
•	exercises and installs relatively quickly. To install only the command-line tools, look for 
•	Build Tools for Visual Studio on the Visual Studio Downloads page. 
•	Before you can build a C or C++ program on the command line, verify that the tools are 
•	installed, and you can access them from the command line. Visual C++ has complex 
•	requirements for the command-line environment to find the tools, headers, and libraries 
•	it uses. You can't use Visual C++ in a plain command prompt window without doing 
•	some preparation. Fortunately, Visual C++ installs shortcuts for you to launch a 
•	developer command prompt that has the environment set up for command line builds. 
•	Unfortunately, the names of the developer command prompt shortcuts and wherethey're located are different in almost every version of Visual C++ and on different 
•	versions of Windows. Your first walkthrough task is finding the right one to use. 
•	７ Note 
•	A developer command prompt shortcut automatically sets the correct paths for the 
•	compiler and tools, and for any required headers and libraries. You must set these 
•	environment values yourself if you use a regular Command Prompt window. For 
•	more information, see Use the MSVC toolset from the command line. We 
•	recommend you use a developer command prompt shortcut instead of building 
•	your own. 
•	Open a developer command prompt 
•	1. If you have installed Visual Studio 2017 or later on Windows 10 or later, open the 
•	Start menu and choose All apps. Scroll down and open the Visual Studio folder 
•	(not the Visual Studio application). Choose Developer Command Prompt for VS to 
•	open the command prompt window. 
•	If you have installed Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools 2015 on Windows 10 or 
•	later, open the Start menu and choose All apps. Scroll down and open the Visual 
•	C++ Build Tools folder. Choose Visual C++ 2015 x86 Native Tools Command 
•	Prompt to open the command prompt window. 
•	You can also use the Windows search function to search for "developer command 
•	prompt" and choose one that matches your installed version of Visual Studio. Use 
•	the shortcut to open the command prompt window. 
•	2. Next, verify that the Visual C++ developer command prompt is set up correctly. In 
•	the command prompt window, enter cl and verify that the output looks 
•	something like this: 
•	Output 
•	C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise>cl 
•	Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.10.25017 for x86 
•	Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. 
•	usage: cl [ option... ] filename... [ /link linkoption... ] 
•	There may be differences in the current directory or version numbers. These values 
•	depend on the version of Visual C++ and any updates installed. If the aboveoutput is similar to what you see, then you're ready to build C or C++ programs at 
•	the command line. 
•	７ Note 
•	If you get an error such as "'cl' is not recognized as an internal or external 
•	command, operable program or batch file," error C1034, or error LNK1104 
•	when you run the cl command, then either you are not using a developer 
•	command prompt, or something is wrong with your installation of Visual C++. 
•	You must fix this issue before you can continue. 
•	If you can't find the developer command prompt shortcut, or if you get an error 
•	message when you enter cl , then your Visual C++ installation may have a 
•	problem. Try reinstalling the Visual C++ component in Visual Studio, or reinstall 
•	the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools. Don't go on to the next section until the cl 
•	command works. For more information about installing and troubleshooting Visual 
•	C++, see Install Visual Studio. 
•	７ Note 
•	Depending on the version of Windows on the computer and the system 
•	security configuration, you might have to right-click to open the shortcut 
•	menu for the developer command prompt shortcut and then choose Run as 
•	administrator to successfully build and run the program that you create by 
•	following this walkthrough. 
•	Create a Visual C++ source file and compile it on the 
•	command line 
•	1. In the developer command prompt window, enter md c:\hello to create a 
•	directory, and then enter cd c:\hello to change to that directory. This directory is 
•	where both your source file and the compiled program get created. 
•	2. Enter notepad hello.cpp in the command prompt window. 
•	Choose Yes when Notepad prompts you to create a new file. This step opens a 
•	blank Notepad window, ready for you to enter your code in a file named hello.cpp. 
•	3. In Notepad, enter the following lines of code:C++ 
•	This code is a simple program that will write one line of text on the screen and 
•	then exit. To minimize errors, copy this code and paste it into Notepad. 
•	4. Save your work! In Notepad, on the File menu, choose Save. 
•	Congratulations, you've created a C++ source file, hello.cpp, that is ready to 
•	compile. 
•	5. Switch back to the developer command prompt window. Enter dir at the 
•	command prompt to list the contents of the c:\hello directory. You should see the 
•	source file hello.cpp in the directory listing, which looks something like: 
•	Output 
•	The dates and other details will differ on your computer. 
•	#include <iostream> 
•	using namespace std; 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	cout << "Hello, world, from Visual C++!" << endl; 
•	} 
•	c:\hello>dir 
•	Volume in drive C has no label. 
•	Volume Serial Number is CC62-6545 
•	Directory of c:\hello 
•	05/24/2016 05:36 PM <DIR> . 
•	05/24/2016 05:36 PM <DIR> .. 
•	05/24/2016 05:37 PM 115 hello.cpp 
•	1 File(s) 115 bytes 
•	2 Dir(s) 571,343,446,016 bytes free 
•	７ Note 
•	If you don't see your source code file, hello.cpp , make sure the current 
•	working directory in your command prompt is the C:\hello directory you 
•	created. Also make sure that this is the directory where you saved your source 
•	file. And make sure that you saved the source code with a .cpp file name 
•	extension, not a .txt extension. Your source file gets saved in the current 
•	directory as a .cpp file automatically if you open Notepad at the commandprompt by using the notepad hello.cpp command. Notepad's behavior is 
•	different if you open it another way: By default, Notepad appends a .txt 
•	extension to new files when you save them. It also defaults to saving files in 
•	your Documents directory. To save your file with a .cpp extension in Notepad, 
•	choose File > Save As. In the Save As dialog, navigate to your C:\hello folder 
•	in the directory tree view control. Then use the Save as type dropdown 
•	control to select All Files (*.*). Enter hello.cpp in the File name edit control, 
•	and then choose Save to save the file. 
•	6. At the developer command prompt, enter cl /EHsc hello.cpp to compile your 
•	program. 
•	The cl.exe compiler generates an .obj file that contains the compiled code, and 
•	then runs the linker to create an executable program named hello.exe. This name 
•	appears in the lines of output information that the compiler displays. The output of 
•	the compiler should look something like: 
•	Output 
•	c:\hello>cl /EHsc hello.cpp 
•	Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.10.25017 for x86 
•	Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. 
•	hello.cpp 
•	Microsoft (R) Incremental Linker Version 14.10.25017.0 
•	Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. 
•	/out:hello.exe 
•	hello.obj 
•	７ Note 
•	If you get an error such as "'cl' is not recognized as an internal or external 
•	command, operable program or batch file," error C1034, or error LNK1104, 
•	your developer command prompt is not set up correctly. For information on 
•	how to fix this issue, go back to the Open a developer command prompt 
•	section. 
•	７ Note 
•	If you get a different compiler or linker error or warning, review your source 
•	code to correct any errors, then save it and run the compiler again. Forinformation about specific errors, use the search box to look for the error 
•	number. 
•	7. To run the hello.exe program, at the command prompt, enter hello . 
•	The program displays this text and exits: 
•	Output 
•	Hello, world, from Visual C++! 
•	Congratulations, you've compiled and run a C++ program by using the command
•	line tools. 
•	Next steps 
•	This "Hello, World" example is about as simple as a C++ program can get. Real world 
•	programs usually have header files, more source files, and link to libraries. 
•	You can use the steps in this walkthrough to build your own C++ code instead of typing 
•	the sample code shown. These steps also let you build many C++ code sample 
•	programs that you find elsewhere. You can put your source code and build your apps in 
•	any writeable directory. By default, the Visual Studio IDE creates projects in your user 
•	folder, in a source\repos subfolder. Older versions may put projects in a 
•	Documents\Visual Studio <version>\Projects folder. 
•	To compile a program that has additional source code files, enter them all on the 
•	command line, like: 
•	cl /EHsc file1.cpp file2.cpp file3.cpp 
•	The /EHsc command-line option instructs the compiler to enable standard C++ 
•	exception handling behavior. Without it, thrown exceptions can result in undestroyed 
•	objects and resource leaks. For more information, see /EH (Exception Handling Model). 
•	When you supply additional source files, the compiler uses the first input file to create 
•	the program name. In this case, it outputs a program called file1.exe. To change the 
•	name to program1.exe, add an /out linker option: 
•	cl /EHsc file1.cpp file2.cpp file3.cpp /link /out:program1.exe 
•	And to catch more programming mistakes automatically, we recommend you compile 
•	by using either the /W3 or /W4 warning level option:cl /W4 /EHsc file1.cpp file2.cpp file3.cpp /link /out:program1.exe 
•	The compiler, cl.exe, has many more options. You can apply them to build, optimize, 
•	debug, and analyze your code. For a quick list, enter cl /? at the developer command 
•	prompt. You can also compile and link separately and apply linker options in more 
•	complex build scenarios. For more information on compiler and linker options and 
•	usage, see C/C++ Building Reference. 
•	You can use NMAKE and makefiles, MSBuild and project files, or CMake, to configure 
•	and build more complex projects on the command line. For more information on using 
•	these tools, see NMAKE Reference, MSBuild, and CMake projects in Visual Studio. 
•	The C and C++ languages are similar, but not the same. The MSVC compiler uses a 
•	simple rule to determine which language to use when it compiles your code. By default, 
•	the MSVC compiler treats files that end in .c as C source code, and files that end in 
•	.cpp as C++ source code. To force the compiler to treat all files as C++ independent of 
•	file name extension, use the /TP compiler option. 
•	The MSVC compiler includes a C Runtime Library (CRT) that conforms to the ISO C99 
•	standard, with minor exceptions. Portable code generally compiles and runs as expected. 
•	Certain obsolete library functions, and several POSIX function names, are deprecated by 
•	the MSVC compiler. The functions are supported, but the preferred names have 
•	changed. For more information, see Security Features in the CRT and Compiler Warning 
•	(level 3) C4996.

•	When you've installed the tools, there's another tool you'll use to build a C or C++ 
•	program on the command line. MSVC has complex requirements for the command-line 
•	environment to find the tools, headers, and libraries it uses. You can't use MSVC in a 
•	plain command prompt window without some preparation. You need a developer 
•	command prompt window, which is a regular command prompt window that has all the 
•	required environment variables set. Fortunately, Visual Studio installs shortcuts for youto launch developer command prompts that have the environment set up for command 
•	line builds. Unfortunately, the names of the developer command prompt shortcuts and 
•	where they're located are different in almost every version of Visual Studio and on 
•	different versions of Windows. Your first walkthrough task is to find the right shortcut to 
•	use. 
•	７ Note 
•	A developer command prompt shortcut automatically sets the correct paths for the 
•	compiler and tools, and for any required headers and libraries. Some of these 
•	values are different for each build configuration. You must set these environment 
•	values yourself if you don't use one of the shortcuts. For more information, see Use 
•	the MSVC toolset from the command line. Because the build environment is 
•	complex, we strongly recommend you use a developer command prompt shortcut 
•	instead of building your own. 
•	These instructions vary depending on which version of Visual Studio you're using. To see 
•	the documentation for your preferred version of Visual Studio, use the Version selector 
•	control. It's found at the top of the table of contents on this page. 
•	Open a developer command prompt in Visual 
•	Studio 2022 
•	If you've installed Visual Studio 2022 on Windows 10 or later, open the Start menu, and 
•	choose All apps. Then, scroll down and open the Visual Studio 2022 folder (not the 
•	Visual Studio 2022 app). Choose Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022 to open the 
•	command prompt window. 
•	If you're using a different version of Windows, look in your Start menu or Start page for 
•	a Visual Studio tools folder that contains a developer command prompt shortcut. You 
•	can also use the Windows search function to search for "developer command prompt" 
•	and choose one that matches your installed version of Visual Studio. Use the shortcut to 
•	open the command prompt window. 
•	Next, verify that the developer command prompt is set up correctly. In the command 
•	prompt window, enter cl (or CL , case doesn't matter for the compiler name, but it does 
•	matter for compiler options). The output should look something like this: 
•	OutputC:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise>cl 
•	Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.10.25017 for x86 
•	Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved. 
•	usage: cl [ option... ] filename... [ /link linkoption... ] 
•	There may be differences in the current directory or version numbers, depending on the 
•	version of Visual Studio and any updates installed. If the above output is similar to what 
•	you see, then you're ready to build C or C++ programs at the command line. 
•	７ Note 
•	If you get an error such as "'cl' is not recognized as an internal or external 
•	command, operable program or batch file," error C1034, or error LNK1104 when 
•	you run the cl command, then either you are not using a developer command 
•	prompt, or something is wrong with your installation of Visual Studio. You must fix 
•	this issue before you can continue. 
•	If you can't find the developer command prompt shortcut, or if you get an error 
•	message when you enter cl , then your Visual Studio installation may have a problem. If 
•	you're using Visual Studio 2017 or later, try reinstalling the Desktop development with 
•	C++ workload in the Visual Studio installer. For details, see Install C++ support in Visual 
•	Studio. Or, reinstall the Build Tools from the Visual Studio downloads page. Don't go 
•	on to the next section until the cl command works. For more information about 
•	installing and troubleshooting Visual Studio, see Install Visual Studio. 
•	７ Note 
•	Depending on the version of Windows on the computer and the system security 
•	configuration, you might have to right-click to open the shortcut menu for the 
•	developer command prompt shortcut and then choose Run as Administrator to 
•	successfully build and run the program that you create by following this 
•	walkthrough. 
•	Create a C source file and compile it on the 
•	command line 
•	1. In the developer command prompt window, enter cd c:\ to change the current 
•	working directory to the root of your C: drive. Next, enter md c:\hello to create adirectory, and then enter cd c:\hello to change to that directory. This directory 
•	will hold your source file and the compiled program. 
•	2. Enter notepad hello.c at the developer command prompt. In the Notepad alert 
•	dialog that pops up, choose Yes to create a new hello.c file in your working 
•	directory. 
•	3. In Notepad, enter the following lines of code: 
•	C 
•	4. On the Notepad menu bar, choose File > Save to save hello.c in your working 
•	directory. 
•	5. Switch back to the developer command prompt window. Enter dir at the 
•	command prompt to list the contents of the c:\hello directory. You should see 
•	the source file hello.c in the directory listing, which looks something like: 
•	Output 
•	The dates and other details will differ on your computer. If you don't see your 
•	source code file, hello.c , make sure you've changed to the c:\hello directory 
•	you created, and in Notepad, make sure that you saved your source file in this 
•	#include <stdio.h> 
•	int main() 
•	{ 
•	printf("Hello, World! This is a native C program compiled on the 
•	command line.\n"); 
•	return 0;

•	1 File(s) 143 bytes 
•	2 Dir(s) 514,900,566,016 bytes freedirectory. Also make sure that you saved the source code with a .c file name 
•	extension, not a .txt extension. 
•	6. To compile your program, enter cl hello.c at the developer command prompt. 
•	You can see the executable program name, hello.exe, in the lines of output 
•	information that the compiler displays: 
•	Output 
•	c:\hello>cl hello.c

•	７ Note 
•	If you get an error such as "'cl' is not recognized as an internal or external 
•	command, operable program or batch file," error C1034, or error LNK1104, 
•	your developer command prompt is not set up correctly. For information on 
•	how to fix this issue, go back to the Open a developer command prompt 
•	section. 
•	If you get a different compiler or linker error or warning, review your source 
•	code to correct any errors, then save it and run the compiler again. For 
•	information about specific errors, use the search box at the top of this page to 
•	look for the error number. 
•	7. To run your program, enter hello at the command prompt. 
•	The program displays this text and then exits: 
•	Output 
•	Hello, World! This is a native C program compiled on the command line. 
•	Congratulations, you've compiled and run a C program by using the command 
•	line.Next steps 
•	This "Hello, World" example is about as basic as a C program can get. Real world 
•	programs have header files and more source files, link in libraries, and do useful work. 
•	You can use the steps in this walkthrough to build your own C code instead of typing 
•	the sample code shown. You can also build many C code sample programs that you find 
•	elsewhere. To compile a program that has more source code files, enter them all on the 
•	command line: 
•	cl file1.c file2.c file3.c 
•	The compiler outputs a program called file1.exe . To change the name to 
•	program1.exe , add an /out linker option: 
•	cl file1.c file2.c file3.c /link /out:program1.exe 
•	And to catch more programming mistakes automatically, we recommend you compile 
•	by using either the /W3 or /W4 warning level option: 
•	cl /W4 file1.c file2.c file3.c /link /out:program1.exe 
•	The compiler, cl.exe, has many more options you can apply to build, optimize, debug, 
•	and analyze your code. For a quick list, enter cl /? at the developer command prompt. 
•	You can also compile and link separately and apply linker options in more complex build 
•	scenarios. For more information on compiler and linker options and usage, see C/C++ 
•	Building Reference. 
•	You can use NMAKE and makefiles, or MSBuild and project files to configure and build 
•	more complex projects on the command line. For more information on using these 
•	tools, see NMAKE Reference and MSBuild. 
•	The C and C++ languages are similar, but not the same. The Microsoft C/C++ compiler 
•	(MSVC) uses a basic rule to determine which language to use when it compiles your 
•	code. By default, the MSVC compiler treats all files that end in .c as C source code, and 
•	all files that end in .cpp as C++ source code. To force the compiler to treat all files as C 
•	no matter the file name extension, use the /TC compiler option. 
•	By default, MSVC is compatible with the ANSI C89 and ISO C99 standards, but not 
•	strictly conforming. In most cases, portable C code will compile and run as expected. 
•	The compiler provides optional support for the changes in ISO C11/C17. To compile with 
•	C11/C17 support, use the compiler flag /std:c11 or /std:c17 . C11/C17 support requires 
•	Windows SDK 10.0.20201.0 or later. Windows SDK 10.0.22000.0 or later isrecommended. You can download the latest SDK from the Windows SDK page. For more 
•	information, and instructions on how to install and use this SDK for C development, see 
•	Install C11 and C17 support in Visual Studio. 
•	Certain library functions and POSIX function names are deprecated by MSVC. The 
•	functions are supported, but the preferred names have changed. For more information, 
•	see Security Features in the CRT and Compiler Warning (level 3) C4996.

C++ Standard Library reference (STL)
•	Article
•	08/17/2022 
•	
A C++ program can call on a large number of functions from this conforming implementation of the C++ Standard Library. These functions perform services such as input and output and provide efficient implementations of frequently used operations.
For more information about linking with the appropriate Visual C++ runtime .lib file, see C runtime (CRT) and C++ Standard Library (STL) .lib files.
Note
Microsoft's implementation of the C++ Standard Library is often referred to as the STL or Standard Template Library. Although C++ Standard Library is the official name of the library as defined in ISO 14882, due to the popular use of "STL" and "Standard Template Library" in search engines, we occasionally use those names to make it easier to find our documentation.
From a historical perspective, "STL" originally referred to the Standard Template Library written by Alexander Stepanov. Parts of that library were standardized in the C++ Standard Library, along with the ISO C runtime library, parts of the Boost library, and other functionality. Sometimes "STL" is used to refer to the containers and algorithms parts of the C++ Standard Library adapted from Stepanov's STL. In this documentation, Standard Template Library (STL) refers to the C++ Standard Library as a whole.

4.	Developer command prompt shortcuts 
You can build C and C++ applications on the command line by using tools that are included in Visual Studio. The Microsoft C++ (MSVC) compiler toolset is also downloadable as a standalone package. You don't need to install the Visual Studio IDE if you don't plan to use it.
Note
This article is about how to set up an environment to use the individual compilers, linkers, librarian, and other basic tools. The native project build system in Visual Studio, based on MSBuild, doesn't use the environment as described in this article. For more information on how to use MSBuild from the command line, see MSBuild on the command line - C++.
Download and install the tools
If you've installed Visual Studio and a C++ workload, you have all the command-line tools. For information on how to install C++ and Visual Studio, see Install C++ support in Visual Studio. If you only want the command-line toolset, download the Build Tools for Visual Studio. When you run the downloaded executable, it updates and runs the Visual Studio Installer. To install only the tools you need for C++ development, select the Desktop development with C++ workload. You can select optional libraries and toolsets to include under Installation details. To build code by using the Visual Studio 2015, 2017, or 2019 toolsets, select the optional MSVC v140, v141, or v142 build tools. When you're satisfied with your selections, choose Install.
How to use the command-line tools
When you choose one of the C++ workloads in the Visual Studio Installer, it installs the Visual Studio platform toolset. A platform toolset has all the C and C++ tools for a specific Visual Studio version. The tools include the C/C++ compilers, linkers, assemblers, and other build tools, and matching libraries and header files. You can use all of these tools at the command line. They're also used internally by the Visual Studio IDE. There are separate x86-hosted and x64-hosted compilers and tools to build code for x86, x64, ARM, and ARM64 targets. Each set of tools for a particular host and target build architecture is stored in its own directory.
To work correctly, the tools require several specific environment variables to be set. These variables are used to add the tools to the path, and to set the locations of include files, library files, and SDKs. To make it easy to set these environment variables, the installer creates customized command files, or batch files, during installation. You can run one of these command files to set a specific host and target build architecture, Windows SDK version, and platform toolset. For convenience, the installer also creates shortcuts in your Start menu. The shortcuts open developer command prompt windows by using these command files for specific combinations of host and target. These shortcuts ensure all the required environment variables are set and ready to use.
The required environment variables are specific to your installation and to the build architecture you choose. They also might be changed by product updates or upgrades. This variability is one reason why we recommend you use an installed command prompt shortcut or command file, instead of setting the environment variables yourself.
The toolsets, command files, and shortcuts installed depend on your computer processor and the options you selected during installation. The x86-hosted tools and cross tools that build x86 and x64 code are always installed. If you have 64-bit Windows, the x64-hosted tools and cross tools that build x86 and x64 code are also installed. If you choose the optional C++ Universal Windows Platform tools, then the x86 and x64 tools that build ARM and ARM64 code also get installed. Other workloads may install these and other tools.
Path and environment variables for command-line builds
The MSVC command-line tools use the PATH, TMP, INCLUDE, LIB, and LIBPATH environment variables, and also use other environment variables specific to your installed tools, platforms, and SDKs. Even a simple Visual Studio installation may set twenty or more environment variables. This complexity is why we strongly recommend that you use a developer command prompt shortcut or one of the customized command files. We don't recommend you set these variables in the Windows environment yourself.
To see which environment variables are set by a developer command prompt shortcut, you can use the SET command. Open a plain command prompt window and capture the output of the SET command for a baseline. Open a developer command prompt window and capture the output of the SET command for comparison. Use a diff tool such as the one built into Visual Studio to highlight the environment variables set by the developer command prompt. For more information about the compiler and linker environment variables, see CL environment variables.
Developer command prompt shortcuts
The command prompt shortcuts are installed in a version-specific Visual Studio folder in your Windows Start menu. Here's a list of the base command prompt shortcuts and the build architectures they support:
•	Developer Command Prompt - Sets the environment to use 32-bit, x86-native tools to build 32-bit, x86-native code.
•	x86 Native Tools Command Prompt - Sets the environment to use 32-bit, x86-native tools to build 32-bit, x86-native code.
•	x64 Native Tools Command Prompt - Sets the environment to use 64-bit, x64-native tools to build 64-bit, x64-native code.
•	x86_x64 Cross Tools Command Prompt - Sets the environment to use 32-bit, x86-native tools to build 64-bit, x64-native code.
•	x64_x86 Cross Tools Command Prompt - Sets the environment to use 64-bit, x64-native tools to build 32-bit, x86-native code.
The Start menu folder and shortcut names vary depending on the installed version of Visual Studio. If you set one, they also depend on the installation Nickname. For example, suppose you installed Visual Studio 2022, and you gave it a nickname of Latest. The developer command prompt shortcut is named Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022 (Latest), in a folder named Visual Studio 2022.
Note
Several command-line tools or tool options may require Administrator permission. If you have permission issues when you use them, we recommend that you open the developer command prompt window by using the Run as Administrator option. Right-click to open the shortcut menu for the command prompt window, then choose More, Run as administrator.
To open a developer command prompt window
1.	On the desktop, open the Windows Start menu. In Windows 11, choose the All apps button to open the list of installed apps. In Windows 10, the list is open to the left. Scroll down the list to find and open the folder (not the app) for your version of Visual Studio, for example, Visual Studio 2022.
2.	In the folder, choose the Developer Command Prompt for your version of Visual Studio. This shortcut starts a developer command prompt window that uses the default build architecture of 32-bit, x86-native tools to build 32-bit, x86-native code. If you prefer a non-default build architecture, choose one of the native or cross tools command prompts to specify the host and target architecture.
For an even faster way to open a developer command prompt, enter developer command prompt in the desktop search box. Then choose the result you want.
Note
By default, the current working directory in a developer command prompt is the root of your Visual Studio installation in the Program Files directory. This isn't an appropriate location for your code and projects. Change the current working directory to another location before you create a project. The IDE creates projects in your user directory, typically in %USERPROFILE%\source\repos.
Developer command file locations
If you prefer to set the build environment in an existing command prompt window, you can use one of the command files created by the installer. We recommend you set the environment in a new command prompt window. We don't recommend you later switch environments in the same command window.
The command file location depends on the version of Visual Studio you installed, and on choices you made during installation. For Visual Studio 2019, the typical installation location on a 64-bit system is in \Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\<edition>. The <edition> may be Community, Professional, Enterprise, BuildTools, or another nickname you supplied.
The primary developer command prompt command file, VsDevCmd.bat, is located in the Common7\Tools subdirectory. When no parameters are specified, it sets the environment to use the x86-native tools to build 32-bit x86 code.
More command files are available to set up specific build architectures. The command files available depend on the Visual Studio workloads and options you've installed. In Visual Studio 2017 and Visual Studio 2019, you'll find them in the VC\Auxiliary\Build subdirectory.
These command files set default parameters and call VsDevCmd.bat to set up the specified build architecture environment. A typical installation may include these command files:
Command File	Host and Target architectures
vcvars32.bat	Use the 32-bit x86-native tools to build 32-bit x86 code.
vcvars64.bat	Use the 64-bit x64-native tools to build 64-bit x64 code.
vcvarsx86_amd64.bat	Use the 32-bit x86-native cross tools to build 64-bit x64 code.
vcvarsamd64_x86.bat	Use the 64-bit x64-native cross tools to build 32-bit x86 code.
vcvarsx86_arm.bat	Use the 32-bit x86-native cross tools to build ARM code.
vcvarsamd64_arm.bat	Use the 64-bit x64-native cross tools to build ARM code.
vcvarsx86_arm64.bat	Use the 32-bit x86-native cross tools to build ARM64 code.
vcvarsamd64_arm64.bat	Use the 64-bit x64-native cross tools to build ARM64 code.
vcvarsall.bat	Use parameters to specify the host and target architectures, Windows SDK, and platform choices. For a list of supported options, call by using a /help parameter.
Caution
The vcvarsall.bat file and other Visual Studio command files can vary from computer to computer. Do not replace a missing or damaged vcvarsall.bat file by using a file from another computer. Rerun the Visual Studio installer to replace the missing file.
The vcvarsall.bat file also varies from version to version. If the current version of Visual Studio is installed on a computer that also has an earlier version of Visual Studio, do not run vcvarsall.bat or another Visual Studio command file from different versions in the same command prompt window.
Use the developer tools in an existing command window
The simplest way to specify a particular build architecture in an existing command window is to use the vcvarsall.bat file. Use vcvarsall.bat to set environment variables to configure the command line for native 32-bit or 64-bit compilation. Arguments let you specify cross-compilation to x86, x64, ARM, or ARM64 processors. You can target Microsoft Store, Universal Windows Platform, or Windows Desktop platforms. You can even specify which Windows SDK to use, and select the platform toolset version.


When used with no arguments, vcvarsall.bat configures the environment variables to use the current x86-native compiler for 32-bit Windows Desktop targets. You can add arguments to configure the environment to use any of the native or cross compiler tools. vcvarsall.bat displays an error message if you specify a configuration that's not installed, or not available on your computer.
vcvarsall syntax
vcvarsall.bat [architecture] [platform_type] [winsdk_version] [-vcvars_ver=vcversion] [spectre_mode]
architecture
This optional argument specifies the host and target architecture to use. If architecture isn't specified, the default build environment is used. These arguments are supported:
architecture	Compiler	Host computer architecture	Build output (target) architecture
x86	x86 32-bit native	x86, x64	x86
x86_amd64 or x86_x64	x64 on x86 cross	x86, x64	x64
x86_arm	ARM on x86 cross	x86, x64	ARM
x86_arm64	ARM64 on x86 cross	x86, x64	ARM64
amd64 or x64	x64 64-bit native	x64	x64
amd64_x86 or x64_x86	x86 on x64 cross	x64	x86
amd64_arm or x64_arm	ARM on x64 cross	x64	ARM
amd64_arm64 or x64_arm64	ARM64 on x64 cross	x64	ARM64
platform_type
This optional argument allows you to specify store or uwp as the platform type. By default, the environment is set to build desktop or console apps.
winsdk_version
Optionally specifies the version of the Windows SDK to use. By default, the latest installed Windows SDK is used. To specify the Windows SDK version, you can use a full Windows SDK number such as 10.0.10240.0, or specify 8.1 to use the Windows 8.1 SDK.
vcversion
Optionally specifies the Visual Studio compiler toolset to use. By default, the environment is set to use the current Visual Studio compiler toolset.
Use -vcvars_ver=14.2x.yyyyy to specify a specific version of the Visual Studio 2019 compiler toolset.
Use -vcvars_ver=14.29 to specify the latest version of the Visual Studio 2019 compiler toolset.
Use -vcvars_ver=14.0 to specify the Visual Studio 2015 compiler toolset.
spectre_mode
Leave this parameter out to use libraries without Spectre mitigations. Use the value spectre to use libraries with Spectre mitigations.
To set up the build environment in an existing command prompt window
1.	At the command prompt, use the CD command to change to the Visual Studio installation directory. Then, use CD again to change to the subdirectory that contains the configuration-specific command files. For Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio 2017, use the VC\Auxiliary\Build subdirectory. For Visual Studio 2015, use the VC subdirectory.
2.	Enter the command for your preferred developer environment. For example, to build ARM code for UWP on a 64-bit platform, using the latest Windows SDK and Visual Studio compiler toolset, use this command line:
vcvarsall.bat amd64_arm uwp
Create your own command prompt shortcut
Open the Properties dialog for a developer command prompt shortcut to see the command target used. For example, the target for the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2019 shortcut is something similar to:
%comspec% /k "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
The architecture-specific batch files set the architecture parameter and call vcvarsall.bat. You can pass the same options to these batch files as you would pass to vcvarsall.bat, or you can just call vcvarsall.bat directly. To specify parameters for your own command shortcut, add them to the end of the command in double-quotes. For example, here's a shortcut to build ARM code for UWP on a 64-bit platform, using the latest Windows SDK. To use an earlier compiler toolset, specify the version number. Use something like this command target in your shortcut:
%comspec% /k "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" amd64_arm uwp -vcvars_ver=14.29
Adjust the path to reflect your Visual Studio installation directory. The vcvarsall.bat file has additional information about specific version numbers.
Command-line tools
To build a C/C++ project at a command prompt, Visual Studio provides these command-line tools:
CL
Use the compiler (cl.exe) to compile and link source code files into apps, libraries, and DLLs.
Link
Use the linker (link.exe) to link compiled object files and libraries into apps and DLLs.
When you build on the command line, the F1 command isn't available for instant help. Instead, you can use a search engine to get information about warnings, errors, and messages. You can also download and use the offline help files. To use the search in Microsoft Learn, enter your query in the search box at the top of any article.
Command-line project management tools
By default, the Visual Studio IDE uses native project build systems based on MSBuild. You can invoke MSBuild directly to build projects without using the IDE. You can also use the devenv command to use Visual Studio to build projects and solutions. Visual Studio also supports build systems based on CMake or NMake.
MSBuild
Use MSBuild (msbuild.exe) and a project file (.vcxproj) to configure a build and invoke the toolset without loading the Visual Studio IDE. It's equivalent to running the Build project or Build Solution command in the Visual Studio IDE. MSBuild has advantages over the IDE when you build at the command line. You don't have to install the full IDE on all your build servers and build pipelines. You avoid the extra overhead of the IDE. MSBuild runs in containerized build environments, and supports a binary logger.
DEVENV
Use DEVENV (devenv.exe) combined with a command-line switch such as /Build or /Clean to execute certain build commands without displaying the Visual Studio IDE.
CMake
CMake (cmake.exe) is a cross-platform, open-source tool for defining build processes that run on multiple platforms. CMake can configure and control native build tools for its supported platforms, such as MSBuild and Make. For more information about CMake, see the CMake documentation.
NMAKE
Use NMAKE (nmake.exe) to build C++ projects by using a traditional makefile.
Note
Starting in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.5, MSBuild and DEVENV don't use the command-line environment to control the toolset and libraries used.

Why get certified 
Summary 
Certification benefits 
We live in exciting times to be working 
in technology. While the words “digital 
transformation” can sometimes seem repetitive, 
we are indeed in a digital era, where so much 
of our technology is dramatically changing. 
Cloud has evolved from being a virtual 
non-entity to exerting a significant influence on 
networking, data center, security, analytics, and 
virtualization. At the same time, cybersecurity 
has become critical across all technology 
sectors and is constantly evolving to counter 
increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks. 
Other transforming technologies include the 
data center, which now plays a central role in 
the business landscape. The Internet of Things 
is now vitally important to our digital lives in its 
ability to connect a staggering amount of data 
and devices. And software-defined networking 
(SDN) has ushered in a sea change in how 
we can manage networks via automation. But 
through it all, routing and switching remain 
the core foundation of knowledge from which 
IT networking professionals can build their 
career as they learn to Connect, Secure, and 
Automate. 
These vibrant technological developments 
culminating all at once can seem 
overwhelming—you need to be able to catch 
the wave of change and ride it smoothly. 
This is precisely why we believe right now is 
the best time to explore how solid training 
and certification can keep you focused and 
help make you a technical superstar in your 
organization.

Pearson VUE surveyed more than 29,000 
candidates who prepared for and earned IT 
certifications during the previous 12 months. 
Its resulting 2021 Value of IT Certification 
Report

features insights from North America, 
Latin America, Middle East and Africa (MEA), 
India, Greater China, Japan and the rest of 
Asia Pacific (APAC). 
Demand for IT certifications is growing, reflected 
by a 16 percent increase in the number of IT 
certification exams delivered from the previous 
year. And since employers were less likely to 
cover training and certification costs, those who 
earned a certification did so using their own time, 
money and effort—a strong indication that the 
desire to certify holds strong and is on the rise. 
Of candidates who earned certifications in 
2020, 86 percent plan to pursue additional 
certifications over the next 12 months.

Cisco can offer you training and certification for 
all of the hot fields. But, first, you need more 
answers to the question of why it matters. With 
this eBook, we’d like to share with you our 
answers—gathered from interactions over the 
years with Cisco certification holders—to the 
basic question of “why get certified?” 
We interviewed your peers in the certification 
community about the personal value of Cisco 
certification to them, and arrived at a dozen 
great reasons to give training and certification 
some serious thought. 
Have a read through the following pages and 
be sure to follow the links for the fuller story 
on the various certification holders we have 
spotlighted here. We trust that you’ll walk away 
with a sense of what training and certification 
can do for you in your career.

have, her certifications ensure she has the knowledge to discuss topics and tackle solutions.

Summary 
Certification benefits 
Each of the Cisco students we profiled has a different story, but they all have one thing in common: the will to 
take that important first step toward advancing their career. That first step was earning a Cisco certification. With 
this single act, they broadened their knowledge and skillset. They improved their understanding of networking. 
They earned more respect from their peers. And they became more marketable. 
Stake your claim to the future of technology—and the future you want to build for yourself—with Cisco certifications. 
Your Cisco certification shows the world you have what it takes to work on today’s most advanced networks. 
Yet as technology evolves, so must the skills required to keep pace and maintain active certification. We call 
this the journey of lifelong learning. 
To learn more, visit Cisco Recertification Policy and Cisco Continuing Education. 
The 2020 IT Skills and Salary Report from Global Knowledge 
concludes that achieving a new certification, on average, 
leads to a $13,000 salary increase. 
Lifelong Learning: Since technology and innovation evolve so quickly, 
it’s important that you stay ahead of the latest advances and keep 
your skills up to date. In the digital world, you can never automatically 
assume that you’re completely caught up and know everything—what’s 
new today can become outdated in seconds.© 2022 Cisco and/or its affiliates. All rights reserved.

Summary 
We trust that at least some of the 13 reasons to get certified 
have resonated with you. 
Our digital era—with all of its excitement and change—dares 
us to keep up with it. As many of the individuals highlighted in 
this book have discovered, the pace of innovation in today’s 
technology arenas makes it difficult to earn just a single 
certification and then rest on one’s laurels. Just as businesses 
must always stay innovative and one step ahead of the curve 
to thrive, so must you. 
For many of us, the pace is motivating. Often the conquering 
of one certification challenge fires us up for the next one— 
part of a lifelong learning journey to be the best at what we do.

lives. By learning the latest methods and skills to connect, 
secure, and automate, they gained the self-confidence 
from setting goals, then accomplishing them. And that self
confidence continues to empower them on their career paths. 
We hope that training and certification empowers—and 
transforms—your career too.

Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) 
and REST APIs 
Attack surface 
Authentication (Authentication, Authorization, 
and Accounting [AAA], Radius) 
APIs are published instructions to interface 
with a product or service. APIs enable 
developers to assemble a command or request 
for a service or data, to submit it, and to 
receive any output. They are published and 
maintained by the vendor. 
A collection of all the possible paths a hacker 
or a malware application might follow to 
compromise protected data. 
Authentication is how you control access to 
your network and prevent intrusions, data loss, 
and unauthorized users. 
Continuous Integration/Continuous 
Development (CICD) 
Data formats 
A CICD system provides automated builds 
and tests for creating software, making 
configuration changes, or completing other 
deployment tasks.When using a CICD 
pipeline, coders can continually merge their 
changes to a main branch of an existing 
application, run integration tests on changes, 
keep changes small, and minimize the 
potential for problems due to multiple, gated 
test result requirements.

DevOps 
DNS 
Infrastructure, containers, and   
virtual machines 
A combination of Development (Dev) and 
Operations (Ops), DevOps focuses on 
automation, regularly allowing failures that can 
be automatically fixed with mitigated risks, as 
well as connecting business outcomes to the 
availability goals for a given system. The 
DevOps movement makes developers 
responsible for deployment and also has 
teams use coding workflows and tools to 
manage infrastructure. 
The Domain Name Service (DNS) is like a 
phone book that translates IP addresses into 
human readable form. For example, 
www.facebook.com is 157.240.22.35 (IPv4), 
or 2001:558:feed::1. 
Infrastructure is a generic term for the 
underlying devices, physical or virtual, that 
provide computing power or storage capacity 
or networks, used to deliver software or 
applications. Virtual machines can emulate a 
computer system and are typically built as 
images, providing the same functionality as 
the physical computer. Containers package 
up software and dependencies into one 
descriptive file that contains everything   
to run an application, regardless of the 
underlying systems. 
IP Addresses are like street addresses. Every 
service or server on the internet has a unique 
address where it can be accessed. 
The process of determining the functionality, 
origin, and potential impact of a given 
malware. 
IPv4 is limited to approximately 4 billion 
unique addresses. NAT is a scheme that 
allows a single address for a network (such 
as a small business) to be shared by all the 
users and devices on your network. 
IP address (IPv4 and IPv6, classes, Open 
Systems Interconnection [OSI] and TCP/IP

Network data models (YANG,   
RESTCONF, NETCONF) 
Packet 
Python 
Role-based access control 
YANG is a data modeling language for 
configuration and state data for network 
devices. It stands for Yet Another Next 
Generation. RESTCONF and NETCONF are 
protocols defined by a standards body, so that 
you can manage configuration of network 
devices modeled with YANG. 
A unit of data that can be sent from one 
network endpoint to another. A packet has 
headers, footers, and a data payload, or some 
other information that it carries. The headers 
encode details about how to route the packet. 
A general-purpose, interpreted programming 
language. Python emphasizes code readability 
with whitespace requirements, so it is 
approachable and powerful. Many network 
automation applications and tutorials are 
centered around Python. 
Access to data given to a person based on 
their job function or role. 
Router 
Routing protocols such as Border Gateway 
Protocol (BGP), Enhanced Interior Gateway 
Routing Protocol (EIGRP), and Open 
Shortest Path First (OSPF) 
Security Incident and Event   
Management (SIEM) 
A router connects different networks 
together, providing a route between two 
computers (or servers) in different networks. 
Routers build the internet. 
Routing protocols provide the overall map   
and directions for a packet to find the   
proper destination. 
An approach to security management that 
gathers data from multiple sources (such as 
syslog, device events, and error logs), 
processes the data (including correlation to 
identify potential threats), and raises an alert 
or ticket for further investigation if the threat is 
deemed to be real.Overview

Security Orchestration and Automation 
Response (SOAR) 
Software Development Kit (SDK) 
Subnet 
Switch 
An approach that enables SOC teams to 
manage tickets raised through SIEM (Security 
Incident and Event Management) for threat 
response. SOAR enables automated workflows 
for responding to the threats. 
A platform for writing programs and 
applications targeting an API. It often includes 
documentation, configurations, and tools (such 
as compilers or linkers) to write and execute 
the code to interface with the API. 
Subnetting is a scheme for efficiently 
apportioning or assigning your IP addresses to 
systems in your organization. 
A switch is a component that is used to build a 
network and to connect hosts and servers 
within a network. A switch cannot route 
packets or data between networks. 
Threat intelligence 
Threat hunting 
Time-based access control 
VLAN 
Evidence-based knowledge, including 
context, mechanisms, indicators, implications, 
and action-oriented advice about an existing 
or emerging hazard to assets. 
The process of proactively and iteratively 
searching through networks to detect and 
isolate advanced threats. 
Temporary access to data given to a person 
on a need basis for a period of time. 
A Virtual Local Area Network is a simple 
scheme to build in access control and 
restrictions within a network. It allows you to 
keep “Sales” separate from “Engineering,” for 
example, and to prevent inappropriate access 
to data.Overview
